masterpiece on all levels like nothing else one of the shows you must see before you die,,,
Amazing show with thrill and suspense throughout. Kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through.,,,
Great story and characters.A lot to enjoy.,,,
A strong message with a powerful plot. Absolute to see!!!,,,
A brilliant season in everything. Every detail. Absolutely gorgeous. I will watch it forever. And I will believe that there is no continuation.,,,
One of the most original shows I’ve seen in years,,,
One of the most inventive and well-crafted television shows ever. It changed the game for Netflix and opened the way for more international productions.,,,
"This show really gets How the human mind works. And the best thing this show has to offer is its characters. Wow. These characters are interesting, complex but somehow relatable. And somehow the characters get EVEN BETTER in season 2-3. Best show I have ever seen.",,,
"Squid Game Season 1 remains a great series with a plot that still grabs our attention today. From the beginning to the end of the games, we are shown the true greed of humans and what they are capable of doing for a large amount of money.",,,
"The first season of Squid Game is a MASTERPIECE. The characters are perfectly written, the storylines are developed and completed. Overall, there are some things left unsaid, but most of them are developed later on. Overall, the plot of the series is great, perfectly portraying a caricature of capitalism. They did a great job of showing Korean society, where there is quite a lot of social inequality, where there are people who have financial problems and also problems with the law. Overall, the characters have problems because of their background or simply because they don't have money. The plot is great, honestly, the series didn't need any more seasons, but oh well.",,,
Literally so much fun. I so understand why it's this popular. It makes you care so much about the characters even if you know they're probably gonna bite the dust.,,,
Squid Game will never be as good as this,,,
"Very good tv show, the actors were so good, the plot was entertaining, games were scary and thrilling.",,,
"Despite having some intense scenes with an interesting premise, ultimately the shows attempt at conveying a class-based critique of capitalistic systems & greed spills out in an uninspired and unintelligent fashion. The messaging is so surface level and in your face it's as if the writers are afraid to treat the subject with an ounce of nuance and poignancy lest they alienate their audience of 12 year olds. It's only further weakened by poor acting from many of the contestants, including at times laughably weak voice performances from the English voice actors.",,,
"The first season of Squid Game manages to capture its cruelty and horror on screen. A decent cast, a plot that addresses economic and social issues, and a true story that encompasses the larger story, Squid Game is a good dose of cruelty and competition. 8/10",,,
"It may be hard on the gut, but the first season of Squid Game is nothing short of cinematic greatness.",,,
The best show ever! Definitely worth watching,,,
I loved this season! It is so abnormal yet exciting. I hope everyone can enjoy this!,,,
"This season is perfect! From the mix of thrills and emotion, this season reallly deserves 5 stars.",,,
One of the rare times I’d give a season the full 5 stars.,,,
"The first season is really amazing. The actors are top-notch. The transformation of the main character is something beautiful. Considering that similar events took place in the past, it keeps you in suspense and excitement.",,,
Pretty awesome season 1.,,,
I could win all of these games,,,
Squid Game 1 is 100% a god-send of a season.,,,
Loved it!!!! Crazy good!!,,,
"I like it, it was very brutal and had nice story but I hated the way they painted religion, specifically Christians and Christianity, it felt really blasphemous and wrong, like an attack for no reason.",,,
What a amazing 1st season I remember watching it when it first came back and rewatched it a few times after and alot before the new season and it still amazing kids games but u lose u die what a great idea and when it was a bad time for people it kinda became the biggest thing and this 1st season is why and only why I can't lie,,,
"Excellent. Great premise. It kind of engulfs you, just a little.",,,
"Pointless violence, too long for the plot",,,
Uma das melhores séries que já vi.,,,
An incredible story with characters who had their own struggle to feel their pain.,,,
Initially macabrely entertaining and unusual but ultimately horrible,,,
I think its amazing but episode 2 was a bit boring. Everything else is high stakes and jaw dropping. What an amazing show,,,
"This is definitely the best season of the show, no doubt, this season offers memorable characters, amazing acting and a very amazing well crafted story, I really felt that this was a perfect season, while I thought they could have explore a little more, it stays perfect like this",,,
E a melhor de todas,,,
Squid game season 1 is a cinematography masterpiece. The first episode was a little bit of a drag but it was most definitely worth it too see the rest of the games.,,,
"Squid Game Season 1 is one of the most exciting and heartbreaking shows I’ve ever watched. It starts with a simple concept—456 people playing childhood games for money—but quickly turns into something way darker and more emotional. The stakes are life or death, and every game brings more tension, fear, and unexpected choices. The plot is strong from beginning to end. Each episode pulls you in deeper, and the games get more intense and creative. But what really makes the show hit hard is the emotional weight behind the games. It’s not just action—it’s the stories behind the players. Every character has a reason for being there, and many of them are struggling with poverty, guilt, or trying to protect their families. Some of the saddest parts of the season genuinely broke me. Ali’s betrayal during the marbles game hit like a truck—he was kind, trusting, and deserved so much better. Sae-byeok’s quiet strength and her tragic death right before the final game was another moment that left me speechless. Even Sang-woo’s slow downfall and final choice showed how much guilt can destroy a person. Then there’s the final twist: discovering that Oh Il-nam, the old man we thought was just a sweet player, was actually behind it all. That reveal made everything feel even more painful, like all the suffering was just a game to the rich. By the end, even though Gi-hun wins, he doesn’t feel like a winner. He’s broken, confused, and angry. And honestly, I felt the same. This show made me think—not just about the characters, but about real life. About how unfair the world can be, and how desperation can push people to the edge.",,,
Great movie great performance in the movie too,,,
"Incredibly exciting. In fact, quite shocking! I really enjoyed the development of each character in the plot.",,,
It has it’s bloody moments.🩸☠️,,,
Einfach Perfekt von Anfang bis zum Ende so macht man es.,,,
"Squid Game S1 offers creative storytelling, complex characters, deep themes, and well-executed plot twists. The pacing and many set designs are top tier, as well as many of the actors' performances. The protagonist's arc from being a piece of *** in the beginning, to slowly revealing his kind-hearted nature leaves the viewer no choice but to root for him.",,,
"great television, great story. watch this.",,,
"Absolute masterpiece, the show should have ended after this season.",,,
"Nothing about this show could have been better. I loved the plot twists, and the way the story changed a lot. It wasn’t that predictable, which is a good thing. One of my favorite shows definitely. Loved it so much! If you like action and a bit of thriller, this show is for you.",,,
"Greatest show on Netflix , hands down.",,,
"(CASTELLANO) Cuando uno empieza El juego del calamar, lo hace con curiosidad. Esa premisa tan sencilla —personas desesperadas compitiendo por dinero a vida o muerte— atrapa desde el primer momento. Pero lo que parece una serie de supervivencia al uso va desvelando, poco a poco, una crítica feroz al sistema, al capitalismo más salvaje, al egoísmo como motor de la sociedad. Es brutal, sí, pero también honesta. No pretende disfrazar su mensaje con metáforas: lo lanza directo a la cara. Cada episodio aprieta un poco más las tuercas. Los juegos infantiles, que deberían evocar recuerdos cálidos, se transforman en trampas macabras. La estética colorida y casi naïf contrasta con una violencia que nunca es gratuita, sino que está puesta al servicio de una idea: la vida es una competición, y perder puede costarte todo. La dirección sabe jugar con esa dualidad y consigue que el espectador esté incómodo… pero enganchado. Uno de sus grandes aciertos está en los personajes. Son imperfectos, humanos, contradictorios. Nadie es del todo bueno ni del todo malo. Algunos eligen la traición, otros la compasión, pero todos lo hacen desde un lugar comprensible. Eso hace que cada decisión duela, que cada muerte impacte. No es solo una cuestión de guion bien pensado, sino de interpretaciones potentes y sinceras, especialmente la del protagonista, que transmite el desgaste emocional capítulo a capítulo. La serie también destaca por su ritmo. No hay apenas episodios de relleno. Cada juego, cada prueba, cada conversación suma. Incluso cuando baja la intensidad de la acción, mantiene la tensión narrativa. Y eso no es fácil en una historia que podría haber sido simplemente “violencia espectacular”. Aquí no hay espectáculo gratuito, hay una historia que avanza con paso firme hacia su clímax. Visualmente, es un espectáculo. Los decorados, el vestuario, el uso del color, todo está cuidado al detalle. Y, sin embargo, nunca se siente artificial. La violencia es explícita, sí, pero no es un fin en sí mismo. Lo que asusta no son solo las muertes, sino lo que representan: lo fácil que es perder la humanidad cuando el mundo te la quita a mordiscos. El juego del calamar no es perfecta —ninguna serie lo es—, pero consigue algo que pocas logran: te deja pensando después de cada episodio. No solo por lo que has visto, sino por lo que sugiere. Por eso, más allá del fenómeno viral que supuso, merece ser recordada como una gran serie. Y como un espejo incómodo donde no todos querrán mirarse. (ENGLISH) It’s not every day that a series manages to mix social criticism, visual spectacle, and narrative tension with such precision. Squid Game does just that—and it does it in the most disturbing way possible. Beneath its seemingly surreal games lies a painfully real and universal message: in a world ruled by debt and inequality, life itself becomes just another competition. And that's what hits the hardest. The first episode is a masterclass in how to hook an audience without needing to explain everything at once. As each game is revealed, the tension builds, and you realize you're watching something much darker than just a survival show. The bright colors and childlike designs only serve to enhance the horror. But it's not just visual brilliance or plot twists that keep you watching. The characters, flawed and desperate, feel incredibly human. You understand their choices, even when they terrify you. That empathy is one of the show's biggest achievements—and what makes it unforgettable. It’s brutal and unflinching, but never gratuitous. Its violence has purpose, and its absurdity mirrors the society it critiques. The irony is constant, and the questions it raises stay with you long after the final game ends. Few series manage to create such a perfect storm of entertainment and meaning. It’s addictive not only because of its plot, but because of the uncomfortable truths it reveals. Squid Game isn’t just a success for Netflix—it’s a cultural phenomenon.",,,
"Absolutely twisted and written in such a captivating and jarring away, thoroughly enjoyable",,,
"I love Asian films/tv shows, they bring you in with strength and this season does just that. Genius, powerful and worthy of binge watching.",,,
Absolute masterpiece.,,,
Go see it at once let the games begin,,,
a half less cuz of the season 2 and 1 star cuz season 3,,,
"“Squid Game” Season 1 exploded onto the global stage in 2021 with a chilling, socially resonant survival game concept. With its bleak portrayal of debt, desperation, and human morality, it blended sharp satire with raw human emotion. Director Hwang Dong-hyuk delivered unforgettable visuals (like the doll in “Red Light, Green Light”), and Lee Jung-jae’s performance as Gi-hun was both heart-wrenching and magnetic. The show’s emotional stakes and brutal surprises set a new benchmark for dystopian drama. Highlights: • Fresh, original premise. • Social commentary on class disparity. • Visually striking sets and game design. • Global cultural impact.",,,
"Perfect story, you really get to know each character. I cried so many times because some of my favorite characters died, can’t get the same feeling from the other seasons.",,,
"Las muertes son bastante impactantes y gráficas, pero las actuaciones de los actores logran transmitir muy bien la intensidad y el drama de cada escena.",,,
Absolute Cinema!!! Very good story to learn.,,,
THE BEST SEASON JUST BRING BACK MY GIRL SAE-BYEOK,,,
"Squid Game is a masterclass in storytelling. The acting is raw and powerful, the writing is sharp and thought-provoking, and the direction keeps you on edge from start to finish. Every element—from the visuals to the emotional depth—is executed flawlessly. A gripping, unforgettable experience.",,,
"I thought it was going to be like 1% plot 99% gore, but it ended up having more plot than expected. I think they could’ve like ended halfway through the final episode and it would’ve been fine. although for a show that was so popular, I’m pleasantly surprised. but people making “squid game in real life videos” makes even less sense to me. it’s cool. I like it too. but that’s kind of like making a “real life hunger games” imo.",,,
"SOLO EL FINAL ES MALO, SI SE HUBIERA ACABADO DONDE LE DICE A SU MAMÁ MUERTA QUE YA TIENE DINERO HABRÍA TERMINADO PERFECTO.",,,
Absolutely fantastic.,,,
"I don't get the hype, it's pretty boring",,,
One of the nest TV shows ever made,,,
First class season. This is how you do it.,,,
Game changer at it's time in 2021. Probably peaked at Season 1. Episode 5 is just heartbreaking. Would have been perfect if they just ended it after Season 1. Must-see.,,,
Best thing in streaming tv in years,,,
Scar concept. Very good visual effects. Believable acting. And very sad. This series is truly great.,,,
THE BEST SEASON FROM ALL,,,
Season 1 is so good and it’s a classic l!,,,
"Squid Game Season 1 is a gripping, high-stakes thriller that blends intense survival drama with sharp social commentary. Its unique concept—desperate contestants competing in deadly versions of childhood games for a massive cash prize—keeps viewers on edge. With compelling characters, emotional depth, and shocking twists, it’s both entertaining and thought-provoking, making it a global sensation.",,,
"Está temporada es la mejor 👌, mejor es quedarse con la primera temporada. La temporada dos y tres nunca existieron 🥲",,,
"Squid Games’ freshman season hits a home run every time. It’s shot beautifully with intricate and colorful sets; grotesque, thought-provoking horror is infused within every scene. The colorful and playful game areas are juxtaposed by the horrors of what happens if you are eliminated. The gore is top notch and the deaths of the characters we come to love are tear-inducing every. single. time. The games are, in practice, simple enough to understand, but have shocking twists to them. Death. Whether you’re looking for a soapy K-Drama or a traumatizing thriller, Squid Games will not disappoint.",,,
This is a very-well written season of the season. The storyline is sad and gripping with proper characters development. The games are also at high stakes. This is highly recommended to anyone and it's worth giving a try.,,,
"One of the best television shows ever, ESPECIALLY season 1. 100% the best Netflix original show. In all honesty, the show could have stopped after season 1 and been perfect. Seasons 2&3 are good, but season 1 is just mind blowing. The plot, symbolism, and character development are all amazing. It is worth the hype and a must watch.",,,
The series should have ended here.,,,
It is not needed to say this is the most influential show in recent time.,,,
"This season gripped onto the main plot - the rich exploiting the poor. It shows how VIPs can bet on the players for money, dehumanizing them in the act. It makes them seem solely like betting on horses, no real value. This season is deep and surprising.",,,
"While there are less well-written episodes, overall it's AWESOME!",,,
"So many emotions. It kept me tense, angry, heartbroken, all at once. That twist? Brutal. I still haven’t recovered.",,,
"A primeira foi realmente boa, deixando as pessoas intrigadas com muitas dúvidas. Pondo-nos no lugar do personagem e suas escolhas morais e éticas. Apesar do baixo orçamento a série não foi uma ""lavagem de dinheiro"".",,,
Love this series. Love the games and everything,,,
"Great, amazing, tear jerker, fantastic, well made- just all the definitions Of good!!!",,,
"Season 1 is carried by its perfectly crafted characters and emotionally charged storytelling. The early backstories, not just of the protagonist but also the side characters, give weight to every decision and death that follows. The games are thrilling and push the plot forward in their own unique and unexpected ways. This is a season with few weaknesses, all of which are overlooked by the highest of highs.",,,
Coming back after seeing Squid Game season 3 to give the only good season a 5 star rating.,,,
Would this work have succeeded even without the coronavirus? Would millions of people have paid to see this movie in theaters? Its artistic quality leaves room for doubt.,,,
Season 1 is a masterpiece.,,,
"What a great show! It keeps you completely wrapped up in it, and as soon as you stray from it, it pulls you in even harder. The cast is perfectly chosen, and their backstories keep you gripped by every actor. I even felt a sense of mourning as each character exited the game.",,,
One of the best firing seasons of a show I have ever watched.,,,
What a show with such peak writing and performances,,,
"Everything from the visuals and cinematography, makes this show binging way more entertaining.",,,
This is the first series I've ever enjoyed this much in my life. It's the best!,,,
My favorite show of all time the only thing that I didn’t like was the last episode. To figure out ohillnam was the game master aka the old man ruined his character it would have been a good ending to his character in the marbles game,,,
I like first season a lot,,,
"Excellent characters and storytelling with a very original premise. Had me hooked throughout the entire season with no bad episodes and incredible games every single episode. Episode 6 was absolutely gut-wrenching and is one of the saddest episodes of television I've ever seen. Although seasons 2 and 3 weren't as good, I feel like they don't really harm the reputation of this season nor should they. Season 1 is absolutely incredible and should still be regarded as one of Netflix's best season's of T.V ever!",,,
"Absolutely thrilling, so many twists and turns. One of the only shows that I’ve ever binged, and only because once it pulled me in with its sick reality I had to watch",,,
"Squid Game is a gripping psychological thriller that challenges viewers to reflect on humanity and the consequences of our choices. 456 debt-ridden contestants are lured into a mysterious competition where they must compete in twisted versions of childhood games for a massive cash prize. But behind the bright colors and simple rules lies a deadly trap—one that pushes their loyalty, morality, and desperation to the limit. Far more than a standard thriller, Squid Game serves as a chilling commentary on economic inequality and the brutal reality of survival under capitalism. It forces you to ask: what would you do if everything was on the line? The writing is tight and purposeful. It doesn’t waste time with filler—every episode builds tension and reveals just enough about the characters to keep you emotionally invested. The use of childhood games as a storytelling device is brilliant, turning innocence into horror with devastating effectiveness. It’s not subtle, but it doesn’t need to be. The show knows exactly what it wants to say—and it says it loud. A few plot points stretch believability, and some characters fall into familiar archetypes, but these flaws barely register in the face of the show’s relentless momentum and emotional weight. Squid Game is violent, bleak, and occasionally absurd—but it’s also unforgettable. It grabs your attention and doesn’t let go, even after the final game ends.",,,
Need I say more. Lorem ipsum. 10/10,,,
"First rewatch since I first saw it in 2021 and boy does it hold up well. Thrilling, emotive, and very dark with its interesting commentary on capitalism and what people will and won't do to survive. The characters are well written and you invest in them. It takes a little while to find it's footing but doesn't look back when it hits its stride. Now comes the rewatch of season 2 which I am hoping may improve on a second viewing but it will never compare to this masterpiece of TV. Time will tell whether this should have been a stand alone series.",,,
"Making a used up run out idea into a hell of a show, I like it!",,,
Violent and macabre. Squid Game is not for the faint of heart but is executed almost perfectly with a bunch of new ideas..,,,
"Squid Game has a unique storyline, featuring various life-threatening challenges, and its set design effectively supports the intense atmosphere of the film,However, the characters lack depth.",,,
Best movie of 2021 & sad....,,,
"I loved it, it was very engaging with great characters. I cried at the deaths of Ali and supposedly the old man in Gganbu. Great.",,,
"It was an unique watch. The entire concept of the show has been repetitive, but this was the best use of it. I loved it!",,,
"Squid game is a very interesting show. It is about people who play to win money but the Games are dangerous and they risk they lives is exciting and sometimes scary. The charracheters are interesting, and you want to know what will happen next. The show is sad but also funny to watch. It makes you think about life and choices. I really liked it, and I recommend it to people.",,,

I really like It, and i recommande It to other peaple.",,,
"Squid Game Season 1 is a thrilling South Korean action series with outstanding performances, especially by Lee Jung-jae and Jung Ho-yeon. The vibrant, eerie sets and gripping plot blend suspense, drama, and social commentary, making it unforgettable.",,,
"I'm glad that a Korean series, especially one of this quality has gotten so much international recognition, because it deserves it. It's mostly an excellent, ultraviolent and provocative show about a very intense series of children's games that forces the audience to keep watching.",,,
"Extremely overrated. A story so predictable that the episodes are often very slow. It's full of clichés, a contradictory message, extreme (and sometimes unnecessary) violence, and cheap sentimentality—it's truly a waste of time.",,,
An amazing story filled with a roller coaster of emotions,,,
"Love it, great story",,,
Love it. It’s a must watch. And it’s one of a kind. New kind of show.,,,
squid game has kills is comedy of the based on a true story,,,
Original and exciting. Really enjoyable even if you don't like violence. Surprises galore,,,
"This was awesome I loved it, such a good season I can’t wait for season 2 and see what happens next , every scene of this show was amazing and pretty sure a lot of people would like it too",,,
This season was awesome! I loved everything about it from the characters to the villians to the challenges to everything. (My favorite characters were Ali and the frontman personally.) Also I love the second story line of the player who’s pretending to be a guard. This is awesome. Everyone should see this.,,,
The best korean drama ever made.,,,
I love it when Show has me locked in has me wanting to see the very next episode. I’ve been rewinding certain parts to make sure I don’t miss some man this season did everything that.,,,
"10/10 must watch at all times so good, so worth it season 2 is even better than season 1, im so excited for season 3, but season 1 is amazing too",,,
"This was one of the most intense shows I ever watched. Every minute had me on the edge of my seat, and I found myself cheering on all of the characters, even the bad ones. I definitely recommend it for action and thriller fans!",,,
"This is probably my favorite show. Everybody did such good acting, and what a creative idea. I can understand how so many people love this show, because it is 100% the type of show to keep you wanting for more. By that I mean a lot of plot twists, a bunch of characters, and just good everything. I've watched the first season around 5 times before season 2, and I just finished season 2 for the second time, if that makes sense. Stay tuned for my season two review. Great job, whoever made this show. God bless.",,,
"Dans un format violent, coloré et cynique, avec un rythme à vous rendre accroc, Squid Game est une plongée réussie dans une univers qui met en scène la cupidité du monde moderne et ses jeux pervers.",,,
It is a very captivating show and also the storyline is really good. Definitelly recommend it.,,,
"Season Average: 8.222 Let's begin with this extremely real question, what would you be willing to do when you are on the brink of destruction from your crippling financial situation and you and your loved ones and spiralling down into Hell? Or rather, what would you not do to escape this? Mysterious people behind gilded and bejewelled masks invite you to play for billions of dollars - the only catch? The stakes are your lives. But, speaking for people who have drowned in debt and bankruptcy with no hopes of escaping the abysmal, does it really make a difference? It takes a game for them to realize the stakes up close, but would they accept a hand for redemption? Or are they doomed beyond any help that they have to forsake everything for a chance to win this monumental bet? A series of six games and 455 deaths - bring out that trolley problem again. This is a brilliant masterpiece treading dangerous waters—of poverty, greed, lust, violence, and grotesque death. The writing is uncanny, and we love and hate the characters as the plot unfolds. We cry for them, cheer for them, and root for them. Some parts felt annoyingly slow, but the story was great overall. The games and the eliminations were notable, directly speaking to the viewers. The Squid Game is not just a battleground of players beating each other to their deaths. It is a plight to be reflected upon, shedding light on the darkest corner of the room which we all overlook - if this is what morality has come down to, then is anything left of humanity?",,,
Was absolutely sucked into this series. No complaints what so ever.,,,
Sheesh! I wanted to both participate in this game and run away from it screaming. Top performances and excellent storytelling.,,,
"Incredible, creative and compelling story! Watched it way too quickly and wish I could soak up the story even more. Looking forward to season three!",,,
"Truly a revolution in entertainment, worldwide. Squid Game goes well beyond the Hunger Games or Gladiator films of our time. While yes there’s scores of violence and shock, there’s also genuine glimpses of vulnerable connections, authentic moments of hilarity, and believable dillemas. Not for the faint of heart…but it’s nuanced enough to be a great mix of action, intelligence, emotion, and suspense.",,,
"The best season of the two without a doubt proving that it is not just any series, deserved the 5 stars from start to finish",,,
Absolute cinema. Interesting games,,,
this is actually so peak,,,
"This show has some of the best acting I have ever seen, the actors portray their characters beautifully and makes the show more depressing than what it's supposed to be. The show is a must watch!",,,
Uma das melhores séries da Netflix e talvez tbm seja uma das melhores séries da Coreia,,,
I absolutely love this show! It's thrilling and always excited to watch the next episode. I just wish it never ended. Can't wait for season 3!,,,
"Overly brutal show whose popularity makes you worry about the state of the world. But, good.",,,
"A MUST SEE SHOW - Very good idea and execution, was definitely excited to see more of it!",,,
It’s really good. Its kinda sad but that just makes it better tbh,,,
"An amazingly creative dark satire on class exploitation in South Korea with vivid seat & costume designs contrasted by its dark tone & violence, all carried through with its emotionally engaging cast of desperate characters.",,,
Too violent from the start of even the first 6 minutes. Very bad and so much inappropriate for schools and to even hear. Blood and gore is high. Don’t watch if a kid,,,
"""Squid Game"" was an interesting series, but not my favorite.",,,
"Really good series, everything about is overall great.",,,
The dub is a joke. Acting dry. Uninmersive. It feels like a movie done by a school project.,,,
مسلسل جميل جدا ورائع تقييمى للجزء الاول %93,,,
"8.4/10. It’s good, just shy of being great.",,,
Love this series. Nice script and actors.,,,
"Very entertaining. Good performances, gripping story, and much more. Original and powerful.",,,
"🍅7.9/10 Very very very watchable I watched episodes 3-7 in one sitting. So for binge worth it has that. Episode 6 was definitely the best it maybe lost a bit of weight after the reveals in episode 9 but still it was really good. There was a lot of good creative games I think my favorite was probably Ppopgi, Marbles, and Glass Tile. Now get some negatives out of the way I hated every second of the VIPs there commentary was annoying. And another thing is the detective subplant. It was very interesting at first, but it ended in a cliffhanger literally so I really hope we get closer in season 2.",,,

Excellent very original had me sweating during the tug of war scene!!,,,
"Season 1 of Squid Game was underwhelming. The first game was thrilling, but the subsequent ones failed to live up to that initial excitement. The characters were mostly unlikeable, and their backstories were only revealed midway through the season. By the time we got to know them, it was clear they were neither relatable nor appealing. While I understand the intent behind how the story was told in regard to the twists, the execution felt clumsy. I much preferred the first couple of seasons of Alice in Borderland.",,,
"Squid game was and is a fresh of fresh air for me. Its a really interesting concept that was executed perfectly. It was a blast all throughout the season, All the characters feel important, and likeable (almost all of them) It manages to balance fun moments and dark moments flawlessly. If gore and violence dosn't matter to you, deff go check the show out, you wont regret it!",,,
"Review as watching a series for first time - It definitely is not recommended for kids as it contains too much of foul language and few vulgar scenes, but overall it is good except such scenes. I never watched any series before. When season 2 of Squid game released I thought to start watching it. I completed season 1 in 3 days and then the very next day completed the whole of season 2. It was very interesting and kept me involved since beginning. Each character was portrayed very well by respective actors. This was the first time I ever watched something from the Korean makers. Lee Jung-jae was extraordinary in his role. Now waiting for season 3.",,,
Awesome! Very creative and full of suspense and new concepts. Loved it!,,,
"This is one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. It was thrilling and intense! However, the show is not for the faint of heart. It is violent, merciless, and savage. I was captivated the whole season. I have never seen a show so unique. The characters are wonderful, so at times the show can be heartbreaking. There are also a few fantastic twists that I did not see coming! The first time I watched the show dubbed in English. The voice overs on the English version can be over the top and cheesy at times. I watched the second time in Korean with English subtitles. The acting is much better and it was more enjoyable! This is a must see show…if you can handle the brutality.",,,
So engaging from the start with a catchy storyline Even if you have watched it it it’s a series to always go back to.,,,
"Definitely a must see and would take top slot if you wanted to rank the whole apocalyptic dystopian korean game show genre, which I am generally not a fan of. Squid Game stands apart as being as unique as you can be for film and television playing off the Running Man concept. Game show where it's life or death. Age old, yes, but fresh anyhow. I recommend it.",,,
"Best show I've ever watched, truly.",,,
"Great show, giving people the idea of class consciousness. In a post Luigi Mangione world, I just hope people remember it’s us vs billionaire and multi millionaire class. And not us vs each other.",,,
"OMG. This show is the most edge-of-your-seat thing I've seen in a long time! Super thrilling, scary, intense, thought-provoking. Wow. I laughed and cried and became so invested in the characters. This show is extremely well-done and super engaging. The tug-of-war scene in particular - I have never been so moved or so scared out of my mind as I was watching that scene. So heart-pounding!! The ""red light/green light"" scene - omg! The juxtaposition of the child-like voice and doll with the violence - just crazy! I loved Season 2 as well and really loved the new characters and scenes and the new intense games, but Season 1 was just particularly insane! I can't wait for Season 3!! Highly recommend this show if you love thrillers and want your heart to pound out of your chest! It's pretty gory; so be prepared for that too! Love it!",,,
"I can't believe I ego'd my way out of ever watching this. I just assumed I wouldn't like it because most of the fans of this show seemed to be weebs or small children with brain rot. While that still might be true, I have to give respect to this show. It's actually way better than I thought. Well worth a watch.",,,
a series that very well criticizes the dark side of human beings.,,,

"i think the story kinda decent, but its still a fun series to watch",,,
"This was so exciting and so many ways. I wasn’t ready for how wild of a series this was going to be. Acting the storyline, the directing was excellent!",,,
A nine episode non-stop adrenaline rush that keeps your eyes glued to the screen from start to finish. Easily the most bingeable show on Netflix.,,,
It's really good. I watched it when it came out and then again now. It still grabs you in. Obviously some faults but overall its a good and innovative show.,,,
"I’m not sure if this is as good as I actually believe it is…..something so different, I really liked it. When I first watched, 3yrs ago? So I rewatched season one, and straight into season two. Season 1 was great.",,,
"I recently completed both seasons of ""Squid Game,"" and I’m eager to share my thoughts now that I’ve fully grasped the cultural impact of this series. With only three seasons planned before it wraps up, I wanted to get my review out before the final season drops later this year. The first season of ""Squid Game"" was absolutely gripping. It centers around a group of individuals who, driven by crippling debt, find themselves abducted and thrust into a series of deadly games where they must compete in childhood activities to win money and gain their freedom. The stakes are high—failure in these trials results in death. Seeing familiar games like red light, green light, and hopscotch transformed into life-or-death scenarios is both surreal and chilling. While some of the games are rooted in Japanese culture and may not resonate with everyone, the overall premise is undeniably terrifying. It raises unsettling questions about the extent of government control over debt and personal freedom. Although the series is dubbed, I found it easy to immerse myself in the story despite the voiceovers. The action is relentless, and the character arcs are well-developed, allowing viewers to stay engaged without being distracted by the dubbing. Season one is a must-watch, and I genuinely believe everyone should experience it. As for season two, there’s a lot of buzz surrounding it, but I can confidently say it’s just as remarkable. The introduction of new characters adds depth to the narrative, and you find yourself rooting for them as the stakes climb even higher. The storyline remains captivating, with genuine emotions that pull you in. Yes, the ending might leave fans frustrated, but it serves as a cliffhanger, perfectly setting the stage for the next installment. It’s reminiscent of classic primetime TV shows where viewers anticipated the next season instead of feeling upset about a conclusion. I wholeheartedly recommend the entire series thus far—it's truly incredible.",,,
Ending could have been better,,,
"Though it started good, the ending just wasnt it for me. Still a good show though",,,
"Some interesting ideas. Some characters come off a bit shallow and some of the twists are bit clumsy or forced. Watchable, and some people may really enjoy it. It just isn't to my taste.",,,
Fantastic inventive story that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.,,,
"One of the best and most entertaining shows ever Squid Game is one of the best Korean shows out there. With engaging characters, a killer story, and an interesting concept. Squid Game is the right path to best thriller shows.",,,
"Es una excelente historia, que sabe mantener el interés y sorprender con sus giros.",,,
"Excellent, very imaginative. I can’t think of anything else like it.",,,
"Just as Season 1, a dark and funny look at the well-known injustices of modern societies.",,,
Koreans know how to make good movies and dramas. It is unrivaled among Asian countries.,,,
Came out of no where. It was a great show and fun premise. The drama was great and the ending was solid. It's a must watch.,,,
"I'm pretty late to the party on this one but it is goddamn amazing. It was a surreal experience and I can't wait to begin with Season 2 soon. Episodes 1-5 were great. They were very well shot, well acted and were just great. I didn't appreciate them as much, however, as I do now when I initially watched them. I was like ""Ok, it's a game where if you lose you die, but there's not much stakes. We know our main characters will live, and they always do"". How wrong I was. Looking back, they are way better than I initially saw them and they are very important, as they set up the characters that you root for and have to watch die. Episodes 6-9, however... was when I fell in love with the show. Episode 6 was a masterpiece and my favourite out of them all. And for the following episodes, the story kept going in amazing ways. I liked the V.I.P's in the later episodes as they made everything feel more real, with how they didn't take the games seriously and saw them as just things to bet on, with how one of them was only annoyed and not horrified at 069's suicide attempt. Episode 9 was a masterpiece aswell, with how we get callbacks and see older characters to show how isolated Gi-hun is. It's just a masterpiece. Overall, brilliant. Simply brilliant. Can't wait to watch Season 2!",,,
Korean drama horror at its finest.,,,
"Squid Game Season 1 is an intense, thought-provoking masterpiece that redefines the survival thriller genre. Combining brutal competition with raw human emotion, the show dives into themes of desperation, morality, and the lengths people will go to for survival. The story follows Seong Gi-hun and a diverse group of participants who are lured into a deadly game for a chance at life-changing money. Each game, rooted in childhood nostalgia, turns into a harrowing fight for life, making the contrast between innocence and violence both unsettling and compelling. The characters are the heart of this series. Each one brings a unique backstory and moral conflict, making the stakes feel personal. The show doesn’t shy away from showing the flaws in humanity, and it challenges viewers to reflect on what they might do in the same situation. Visually, Squid Game is stunning. From the vibrant sets to the eerie design of the masked guards, every detail feels intentional, creating a world that’s both surreal and grounded. The cinematography and pacing keep the tension high, while the soundtrack amplifies the emotional weight of each scene. Season 1 balances brutal action with social commentary, exploring issues like inequality, greed, and the corrupting influence of power. It’s as much a critique of society as it is a survival game, which elevates it beyond standard thrillers. Overall, Squid Game Season 1 is unforgettable. Its mix of gripping storytelling, complex characters, and deeper themes makes it a cultural phenomenon that resonates long after the final episode. A must-watch for anyone who loves thrilling, meaningful television.",,,
You can't stop watching so intens good! Great story and very emotional From begin to end.,,,
the show is fine....,,,
Must watch series..absolute masterpiece,,,
"Podría estar de rodillas viendo ""El Juego Del calamar - Temporada 1""",,,
"It has the best plotline and character development since Harry Potter! Very detailed, planned storyline that represents about 13 years in the making! Spectacular scenery, writing, symbolism, and plot twists! Sad they completely butchered it hard in Season 2.",,,
Full of great surprises and build ups. but at the end it just becomes scholock,,,
"Brutality of capitalism successfully layered into script. Characters are very enticing you support them, hate them, share their pain, horror. Great work of a death game genre with so much depth that genre almost always lacks.",,,
Engaging and entertaining till end. Rating: 8.3/10,,,
Global phenomenon! Netflix got what they wanted: our attention. Worldwide.,,,
"A strong storyline, solid and identifiable characters, the juxtaposition of the horror and the children's games - squid game delivers on the optics, the suspense, and the story. The VIP actors are terrible, but the overall story doesn't need them.",,,
"Netflix's best and biggest original series by far, a masterpiece that deserves all the hype they gave it.",,,
It's sort of a perfect allegory for the unceasingly despairing late-stage capitalist nightmare we're living in.,,,
"It's set in south Korea. It start a ""Lee yung jae"". The main characters are six people. The story is about old children' games in Korea. The series was a thiller but not horror. The series was rated 18+ because there are a lot of killing and bloody scenes. In my opinion the acting was very amazing and creepy. The sound track makes you feel scared . The story was amazing . The first scene was dull and the ending was sad.",,,
"Squid Game was definitely a pop culture phenomenon in 2021, but it did have its flaws. The series did start strong (despite its first episode being a little slow), yet it seemed to slowly lose bits of its charm as the show went on.",,,
it is just not it you know?,,,
Riveting!!! I'll be binge-watching Season 2 the day it comes out...my Christmas present (hope it comes out at midnight)!,,,
"The best thing about Squid Game is that it could have simply just been a death game where flat minded meat puppets die. But this story focuses more on the players than the game itself, which makes for a compelling story. We are not the V.I.P.s, we are the empathizers.",,,
"There are a lot of people saying Squid Game is perfect, but it certainly isn’t. While it is still awesome, there are a lot of flaws. Most of the show’s success comes from the hype around it, which was partially deserved but, in some cases, overstated.",,,
Direção: Bom Atuação: Ok Roteiro: Bom Caracterização: Bom Soundtrack: Bom,,,
This series is good is mid tbh people just overhyped it,,,
Overrated but cool.,,,
"""Squid Game"" is brilliant and innovative. It is an incredibly clever concept from the author/screen writer. Horrifying, and fascinating. I certainly didn't see that coming. Well done and thankyou to the production team. I immersed myself in Korean language and culture after that, and re-watching it became a whole new ballgame. Just wow.",,,
It's a series that you start watching and you just don't realize it until you've finished watching it. A masterpiece.,,,
Disappointed but lead actors Acting r Wow,,,
"Disturbingly brilliant, and couldn’t get enough of it can’t wait for series 2",,,
I always like a death game type of movie and this series done it so good. You can't almost predict what's gonna happen next.,,,
Very eerie and gripping. Would 100% recommend.,,,
was hooked from the beginning,,,
One of my favourite tv series only let down by its ending. If you like this try Money Heist (the Korean version) as well.,,,
Good until episode 10. I know endings are always difficult to write. The journey was great though.,,,
Lots of fun. It is typical violent Korean revenge type of series/movie. But it should have stopped with S1.,,,
I am a sucker for a good death Gane and thus scratches that itch. It is entertaining and engaging.,,,
WoW. That was something else. What people will do for money. Higley recommended. Not sure this need a second season . We got it !,,,
"Greatest TV show ever period! It’s a must watch my eyes were glued to the TV since halfway through the 1st episode. This show consists of all elements of what makes this show the best. As dark and grappling the show was the comedy, that goes overlooked, was fantastic especially the main character, Gi Hun, and Mi Nyeo. They definitely brighten the mood up a bit in this thriller. The old man in the show was my favorite character he’s that 80 year old Asian grandpa all kids needs in their lives whether he’s giving advice to help his team win in tug of war or that sudden lively energy he has to run in red light green light. The music to go along with this show contains a mix of creepy, childlike, trap beat. And the classical music they play here in the show is impeccable to the story. It's the perfect soundtrack for this show. The ending wasn't good it'll admit that, but the whole show is nothing like I've seen so I simply can't give this anything less than five stars regardless. Overall all actors' played their characters' part flawlessly.",,,
"Korean shows rarely disappoint. Always willing to think out of the box, and not afraid to be offensive. This show is no different. Very well done, and thoroughly entertaining and gripping.",,,
Had my eyes glued to the screen since episode one.,,,
Now that's some good tv.,,,
"Solid show althought it is a bit predictable at times, I don't know why they would make a second season however.",,,
“好雨知时节”，这句台词印象深刻，我觉得这部剧也是“知时节”，完美诠释和讽刺了当今的社会现状,,,
Surprisingly gripping and crazy with a story that allows a Season 2 I look forward to watching !,,,
"Good show, koreans really do their survial games better than the japanese",,,
"I almost stopped watching this after a couple episodes. It's not that I disliked it or anything - I just wasn't particularly excited about what I saw, and it didn't feel like a priority. Coming home sick from work, I decided to pick up where I left off and see if my enthusiasm grew. It did. I binged the remaining episodes in one sitting. I was so glad to find that the hype surrounding this series is, for the most part, warranted. This is more than just a series of deadly games in which bloodshed runs rampant. In fact, the games are probably the least interesting aspect here. What really fascinates is the down time between games when we see what greed, fatigue and desperation can do to the human spirit and the human conscience. The middle episodes (particularly episode 6) contain some of the most gut-wrenching, nail-biting and frequently emotional scenes I've watched in a long time. At its best, this is rather extraordinary material that was a lot deeper and powerful than I expected after the first 90 minutes. BUT... the last 30 minutes are quite the letdown. I obviously am not going to go into any detail, but let's just say I didn't buy it, and it kinda puts a bit of a pallor on what has transpired beforehand. Performances are outstanding throughout, even in some of the more cliched roles. I'm sure a second season is inevitable considering the hoopla surrounding these 9 episodes. I'm up in the air whether it's something I would continue watching. But I'm very happy to report that 83% of this is really great work! - Jeff Marshall, Movie Blogger (Facebook)",,,
"This show was pretty exciting and dramatic, the cliffhanger for season 2 was also pretty cool!",,,
wow that was really something,,,
"Loved it! Unique, original — the suspension was killer (literally!). Loved it.",,,
"Interesting and compelling storylines throughout, but overhyped for sure. The message of the need for a smaller government is clear. It is almost libertarian in saying that when the government has power they exercise that power to get people in poverty and ultimately control them. That message is the most interesting part of the show, but the idea that these people would continue in the games is so unbelievable. If you are willing to look at this as a korean soap then it begins to make more sense. One more major problem is the violence porn throughout...no one needs to see that level of violence, which is why I recommend watching this on Vidangel or another service that can cut some of the grotesque violence.",,,
"I liked a lot about this first season. It's biggest failings, for me, we're it's completely irredeemable protagonist and it's unsatisfactory ending.",,,
"Amazing it gives me big vibes of corona ,the time was elite and this show went so viral it was everywhere I loved it still waiting for season 2 ,the nostalgic effects are amazing 2020 already is 4 years ago or was this recorded 21 I dont know both was elite",,,
"Squid Game is, in my opinion, worth the hype!",,,
Interesting; intriguing to try to figure out what would happen next and whether the contestants would make it to the end prize. A little gory at times even for me ( and I have a reputation for owning a pretty high gore threshold). Liked it enough to wait for the second season. But caution that it is not for the faint hearted.,,,
"kinda entertaining, decently made, but completely on the nose, no nuance and therefore in the end quite overrated. both the purge and saw respectively did everything in squid game better already and more.",,,
"I really enjoyed this series, I thought it was really unique, people playing in a real life video game with deadly consequences to play for money, this desperation for money from the characters causes them to make some not so great decisions, even hurting people who are valuable in their lives, which occurs in the movie between 2 best friends (one being the main character we follow) all over money. The plot was fantastic and well thought out too. I also thought it was really clever how they made innocent games that children would usually play and made them have deadly consequences, where if any of the characters fail, they are eliminated by death. it's just a shame the English dubbing was done so poorly, perhaps the worst dubbing seen yet. If that had been done better, this would be more like a 4.5/5 or maybe even 5/5",,,
Best Serie of all Time for me,,,
I would have given 5 starts if it wasn't for the terrible/cringe acting by those Americans. Great show tho,,,
"Entertaining, violent, and sometimes heart-warming with the help of some loveable characters, but suffers from an awfully wrapped-up ending.",,,
90%. 2nd watch. The bridge game episode is one of my favorite episodes of tv. So intense. Absolutely love the concept of this show. Could watch so many episodes. The second episode after the first game and in between the rest of the games that just focuses on their real lives isn't great. Love everything else tho.,,,
"Utter trash. The equivalent of excrement for the eyes, mind and senses. An insult to human values. You are wasting your life watching this. Watchable only if you're depraved / sicko. Worse than The Human Centipede",,,
"Squid Game"" (2021) is a gripping South Korean thriller, blending survival, social commentary, and memorable performances for a compelling watch.",,,
"A disheartening yet visually striking shocker that underscores how the future is shaped during one's formative years, demonstrating that seemingly childlike games can serve as the starting point for societal divides, though it's accompanied by an ending that disappoints.",,,
Too much gratuitous violence for my taste. Not bad otherwise,,,
"It's not that good, really predictable, and I have no idea how it got so hyped. Literally the only part I quite liked was the game in the subway, everything else was just boring.",,,
One of the greatest seasons of television I have ever seen.,,,
It was a good movie but the ending really ruined it. If the ending was better I think this would be one of the best TV shows ever,,,
"A really great season of TV. The production design was great, and the actors did a great job.",,,
A truly artful show that juxtaposes brutal violence with hard-hitting social commentary and beautiful heart-wrenching moments. Definitely worth a watch.,,,
"While the premise for this show seems rather ludicrous, what makes it works is clever and engaging writing along with some sharp social commentary. One of 2021's best shows",,,
"This show depicts many societal problems especially in Korea. Debts, Men patriarchy, sexism... I like how such shows like this. It might be sensitive to children, but its a good show for adults.",,,
"I was late to getting around to watch this one, but once I did it only took two days to binge all nine episodes. Despite the entire show being dubbed, you're still able to develop a real interest in most of the characters and worry about what will happen to them next. There's only one character where the dubbing is just a little off and some of their dialogue loses a little of its effect in translation, but once you're fully engaged in the plot it's barely noticeable. There are some plot twists that are completely predictable, but again the characters and their stories are so interesting that you're more concerned with how the twists will be revealed, rather than just when they'll be revealed. The hype and hysteria around this show are well deserved.",,,
"Too much hype, so watched it later. Don't get the hype, but it was ok. Seems like it was trying to make some point about class and money, but as someone that comes from and has next to nothing, these ""who needs money anyway"" stories never work for me.",,,
It has its cliches here and there but its a fun and an extremely engaging watch. I don't think it needs a season two.,,,
"This is one of my favourite series ever. I've watched it 4 times now, and can watch it again and again. Brilliant story, actors and plot, that had me laugh, be on the edge of my seat, and cry. I don't understand the bad reviews, saying the acting is ""bad"" and it dragged on. Awful critics without a clue. Hopefully no-one will listen to them and give it a watch! Highly recommended.",,,
So overrated. Terrible cringe acting. Ridiculous that it won over Better Call Saul. This show dragged on and on and I could not wait for it to be over.,,,
"This drama is really fascinating. Squid game made me laugh a lot and it also made me cry a lot in Episode 6. I am little bit curious. Oh il nam didn't die at Episode 6, so we all saw him alive at last episode. We could see the girl(Jiyoung) getting shot right after, she saying ""Thanks for playing with me"" at Episode 6. We also didn't see Ali getting a pistol shot. We only heard pistol shot. Therefore, I think there is some possibility that Ali might be still alive and come up at Squid Game drama Season 2. If Ali comes up at Season 2 I think he will be a new front man. I think he will be a little angry by getting deceived at Marble game even he didn't get killed.",,,
"Una serie con una premisa que aunque ya hemos visto con anterioridad aquí nos lo muestran de una forma bastante diferente y creativa a la vez, no solo rompe con los estereotipos en los cuales nuestros protagonistas están atrapados en este tipo de juegos sino que también les da un giro bastante interesante, a mi parecer también comete algunos errores que hacen que la historia sea aburrida en algunas ocaciones como es el hecho de que tiene algunas subtramas que aunque pueden llegar a darle más sustancia a la serie también son bastante aburridas y no llegan a nada, eso si las pruebas son muy buenas e interesantes por el hecho de que no sabrás qué pasará en el siguiente episodio con un nuevo desafío, otro punto que quiero recalcar es el final que se me hace uno de los finales de temporada más innecesarios que he visto no solo porque la historia pudo terminar en una temporada también porque no encuentro que podrán hacer en la siguiente o qué nuevo nos podrían mostrar a los espectadores.",,,
"Gripping story and likable characters. although the last episode was kind of a letdown, it's still a great show",,,
"Squid Game is a Korean Netflix original in which a group of people take part in a mysterious and downright deadly game to win a multi-billion won prize. ""Squid Game"" isn't a bad series, but it doesn't live up to its hype by far. It's very exciting to follow this game of death once, but the characters aren't really particularly written or the twists are somehow surprising. You can watch it if you're in the mood to see something exciting with a brutal touch, but it's definitely not a must. I also don't understand why a second season was commissioned. What should happen now? Let's see what comes, but I think the series is better served with one season...",,,
Overall a awesome series with a great reveal for the big bad of the season,,,
"It's really good, but where can they really go from here?",,,
"""Squid Game"" is a South Korean survival drama television series created and directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, which premiered on Netflix in September 2021. The series has become a global sensation, quickly gaining a huge following due to its gripping plot, well-developed characters, and stunning visuals. The series follows the story of a group of 456 people who are invited to participate in a mysterious game that promises a chance to win a life-changing amount of money. The game involves a series of deadly challenges that escalate in difficulty as the players progress through the rounds. The stakes are high, and players must fight for their survival as they navigate the twisted game of the organizers. One of the strongest aspects of ""Squid Game"" is its well-written plot, which is full of twists and turns that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The pacing is excellent, with each episode leaving the audience wanting more. The storyline is both engaging and unpredictable, which makes the series incredibly addictive and keeps viewers engaged throughout. The acting in ""Squid Game"" is also outstanding. The actors fully embody their roles and deliver strong performances that make the characters feel real and relatable. The standout performance of the series is delivered by Lee Jung-jae, who plays the main character Seong Gi-hun. Lee brings a depth and complexity to the character that is captivating and emotionally charged. Cinematography is another highlight of the show. The series is beautifully shot, and the use of lighting and color is masterful. The visual effects used to create the game's challenges are also impressive, adding to the overall sense of immersion and tension. The music in ""Squid Game"" is hauntingly beautiful, with a mix of classical and modern pieces that add to the suspenseful atmosphere. The music is used sparingly but effectively, with each track enhancing the emotional impact of the scene it accompanies. One of the few drawbacks of ""Squid Game"" is that some of the supporting characters are not as well-developed as they could be. However, this is a minor issue in the grand scheme of things and does not detract from the overall quality of the series. Overall, ""Squid Game"" is a stunning and thrilling masterpiece that is sure to keep viewers engaged from start to finish. With its gripping plot, outstanding acting, stunning visuals, and haunting music, it is easy to see why it has become a global sensation. If you haven't already watched ""Squid Game,"" it is definitely worth the hype and highly recommended.",,,
"The plot is really bad. I mean, really really bad. But once you start watching, you can't stop. It is what a show should be: entertaining. You will want to watch more of it.",,,
"Both familiar and way over-the-top Squid Game delivers a pulse-pounding narrative backed up by a surprisingly robust capitalist critique. At the center of this international sensation is the concept of debt and how that notion has captured and changed our idea of how an economy can work. Debt has a hold on most of us, some more so than others, and Squid Game asks most of us what we would be willing to do to have it erased. The series, which takes place in South Korea, sees hundreds of people, chosen for their uniquely precarious situations compete against each other playing children's games like Red Light, Green Light and Tug-of-War. The prize? 45 billion won, or roughly 38 million USD. The catch? Losing one of these games results in elimination- not just from the game, but from life. The premise is easy to get one's head around, but it's the ramifications of said premise that really make Squid Game shine. Would you be willing to kill another to get your life back on track? Would you be willing to risk another's life by voting to allow the games to continue? What might relationships look like featuring people who have mutually agreed that their own problems outweigh the right to life for another? It's these questions that elicit the best moments in the show as well as what the administrative end of such a wild game might look like. Very quickly Squid Game becomes less about the games and more about the questions that we as viewers neglected to ask because of the outrageous premise. It's a story largely devoid of ""good guys"" that allows its characters to become more animalistic as the show continues toward its exciting conclusion. That said, being a non-native speaker was certainly a limitation. Most of the time, while watching, Squid Game was in the original Korean with English subtitles. The writing was silly at times and simply lackluster during other parts, the words neglecting to carry the weight that they were so clearly fitted for. Apparently, this is a problem being addressed by Korean speakers, but it simply doesn't help for the sake of review. On more than one occasion a line that was supposed to chill blood elicited chuckles instead. While this fact did cheapen some scenes it wasn't endemic enough to ruin the whole show, but it does need mentioning. If you can get past some silly subtitling and an ending that doesn't quite provide the nutrition one wants after a grueling trek, Squid Game will deliver on some pulse-pounding moments and a surprisingly insightful depiction of modern poverty. It's part Lord of the Flies, part Saw with a dash of cold, uncaring classism from films like Parasite, and it's sure to satisfy.",,,
"It's not the plot which is so awesome here. Because when you start watching this you're like ""oh this is another Hunger Games"". So it's not the plot; it's the execution which is absolutely awesome; getting more and more intense as it progresses. And then you see it's a straightforward satire of our brutal crony capitalist dog-eat-dog world; which is not much worse than the vicious Hunger Games they're playing in this movie. By the end you're somehow totally moved. (Didn't think that was possible in a movie that's so violent). Highly recommend!",,,
"I don't usually watch series and even more rarely do i watch Thriller and Drama, but Squid Game is the best movie i watched in a love time. It's original, it's interesting, it's engaging... I stayed until 7:15 AM to watch it. I watched 6 episodes in a row! It was awesome! I constantly thought that i know what was going to happen and i was always surprised that i was wrong. Until the very end, the last 10 minutes, the movie kept me guessing what was going to happen. Now imagine 9 episodes, one hour each in duration... constantly keeping me guessing what's going to happen... OF COURSE I WILL STAY UNTIL 7AM TO WATCH IT!",,,
"Squid Game is an impressive TV show, with the production value of a Hollywood film, and an intriguing and engaging story, weaving in relatable social commentary.",,,
"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! I can't remember the last time I cried while watching something but I was wailing while watching episode 6. You really get emotionally attached to the characters.",,,
"Cómo Squid Game metaforiza y crítica la explotación laboral y le da foco a la clase baja de Corea del Sur la hace increíble, la serie expositivamente es genial pero argumentalmente es muy simple. Expositivamente te cuenta de una manera muy natural, las adversidades que la gente de clase baja tiene que lidiar en un país tan globalizado como lo es Corea, a la vez que critica la ambición destructiva, que para mi es el eje central de la historia, ya sea desde la superficie como el personaje de Sang-Woo que arquetípicamente es el más notorio en la serie, mientras en su constante desarrollo deja ver todo lo malo de la humanidad, desarrollando personajes imperfectos pero humanos, todos los personajes son reconocibles y en varios aspectos identificables con el espectador, la serie hace un gran trabajo en crear personajes con los que es fácil empatizar. Pero argumentalmente la serie es otra historia, cuenta con arcos de personajes que no salen de estereotipos como del ""malo malote"", o de la ""entrometida"", o del ""noble"". La serie principalmente en el capítulo 2 y 3 llega a ser irritante cuando se sobre exterioriza el diálogo en los personajes, haciendo esperar al siguiente juego. Squid Game es una serie que más allá de su violencia e intriga esconde de manera muy inteligente una crítica a la Corea actual, ya sea en las apuestas, en los problemas financieros tan comunes que se viven afuera de la gran Seúl. La serie cuando busca ""mostrar en vez de contar"" es brillante, ya sea en grandes o pequeñas acciones como la pistola encendedor, que para mi representa lo que quiere ser el protagonista, fuerte por fuera pero falso en su interior, o como los altos mandos ven desde sus lugares privilegiados como sus empleados se destrozan la vida en sus compañías, o el último capítulo que en sus últimos 20 minutos logra de una espectacular manera dar un sentimentalismo hacia el sentido de la vida, y como muchos de nosotros tenemos una venda en los ojos que no nos deja ver lo que realmente es importante, criticando los sueños superficiales como a pesar de ""tener todo el dinero de mundo"", si no tienes lo realmente importante no tienes felicidad.",,,
"Games are very creative and interesting. For a show that involves death games, the show has really interesting character development and story arcs.",,,
"I don't know how to compliment this series more. It's easy to watch, exciting, emotional and has messages to think about regarding capitalism and democracy. Just see it any way you can.",,,
"This one surprised me. It actually has a plot, character development and yes, a heart. Who would have thought? A highly addictive ride. A few episodes in and I was fully invested in the characters and plot. And I simply turned it on to see what all the hype was about. Well, now I know.",,,
"Easy to get hooked on it, if you can stand the violence.",,,
Love these types of shows and the Koreans/Japanese seem to do them the best.,,,
"This series is a breath of fresh air between so many junk series and repetitive movies. It was excellent, how excellent? I can easily compare it to the emotion, plot and acting of ""Breaking Bad"". I couldn't stop myself, I had to watch the whole series in one sitting.",,,
"I went through a roller coaster of emotions while watching this. Seong Gi-hun is amazing as player 456. The production music, costumes, and set design were incredible and unlike anything I've seen in television or film. The story was filled with complex characters and situations and I really appreciated the many twists and surprises along the way.",,,
This show is a cultural reset. No other show is like this. The games the characters played were insane to watch. I could not believe how well thought out this show was from the directors and writers of this Netflix series. Truly something special.,,,
"Pacing is a bit drawn out, and a lot rides on the novelty of the games and who will make it, but there's enough there with the characters to also care about how things actually proceed. (Watched subbed, so cannot speak to quality of dub.)",,,
"I saw this series without knowing what it was and I must say it was a surprise, it was really good in everything!!! I recommend.",,,
"Squid Game. If you haven't seen it, your probably lying because everybody and their mom has seen this show or at the very least heard of it. Unsurprisingly, I liked quite a lot. However, I am going to say that there are a lot of issues with it. For one, the ending actually sucks. This show leads up to what I think will a somber ending, but it ends on a note that I think is supposed to be cool. The twist is also awful and is completely irrelevant to the show and only serves to make the show overly complicated. There is this random unnecessary side plot that goes nowhere and it sluggish to sit through. The show is mostly just fine enjoyable television, with the added touch of amazing set design and cinematography. 7/10 Its pretty good.",,,
"Squid Game's unflinching brutality is not for the faint of heart, but sharp social commentary and a surprisingly tender core will keep viewers glued to the screen - even if it's while watching between their fingers.",,,
"It's okay, i have seen more that 400 asian series, this one doesn't have any special, is just entertaining.",,,
"Squid Game has one annoying character and some questionable choices here and there, but it is a riveting, socially relevant and brutal experience that has you consistently hooked with well-written characters and solid production.",,,
"Really enjoyed this series, nice to see an original idea with a no nonsense approach. One tip (at least imho), watch it in the native language with the subtitles, was better than the english dubbing that I tried for one episode.",,,
"Great series. Crazy plot like battle royale, crazy story like hunger games, at the same times feels so relevant with the world's situation.",,,
"Very entertaining. The no holds barred approache is perfect for viewers. After all, if you don't like it. Change the channel. But the rest of us want to be on the edge of our seats. Would watch again and recommend to friends.",,,
Some of the best tv in years. Excellent,,,
"95/100 - Squid Games is one of the best shows I've seen in a very long time. Everyone involved in the acting, writing, directing, score, etc should be proud of themselves at creating such a masterpiece, especially in a time period with such obscure and odd values. This story will captivate you and leave you wanting more (season 2 confirmed for 2024 :D). The music and score were meticulously crafted, evoking an emotional response at every turn. Perfectly executed to immerse you in the situation the characters are in. The desperation, confusion, horror, happiness, relief, and fear felt by every character was masterfully illustrated. I can predict movies and shows down to the T almost every single time. Seriously, most films and television shows this decade are cliche garbage with predictable and stereotypical situations and characters at every turn. Squid Games followed none of the normal tropes and it was a refreshingly beautiful story executed flawlessly. It paid of well, kudos to you Hwang Dong-hyuk. Well worth the watch and I have and will rewatch it again.",,,
"The social commentary is a little heavy-handed with this one, but there's no denying that it is well acted and directed. It hooks in the viewer by featuring a flawed but somewhat likeable and sympathetic main character, Seong, played by Lee Jung-jae. I found it hard not to root for him, but if you don't warm to him, I doubt you'll get much out of Squid Game. The show is absolutely brutal, and literally not for the faint-hearted - one of episode left me with mild palpitations and I had to go for a walk to calm down! I suspect that the brutality will be too much for some audiences, but if you can push through it you're in for a wild ride. I won't say an enjoyable ride, since this was not easy to get through.",,,
"Mindblowing concept, incredibly interesting plot, amazing writing, pacing and acting. It will keep you on the edge of your seat while you binge the entire thing hoping for your favorite character to win. Powerful, intense, emotional. Highly recommend!",,,
one of the most gripping and entertaining series ive seen in years,,,
gripping stuff! thoroughly enjoyed it! can't wait for season 2,,,
"Does the perfect series exist? this game close! Loved the premise even if there are some pretty obvious plot holes, they don't detract from the show",,,
your life is not complete until you watch this,,,
Very creative show. Wish there was an English version but the voice overs are not too distracting.,,,
One of the best series you can binge watch on Netflix. Great concepts and characters. Can't wait for the next season.,,,
"Squid Game is the best show of 2021. What starts off as a general drama goes into territory of terrifying. The show's themes of rich and poor is so well crafted, like Parasite. A couple of the games like the tug of war and glass stepping stones are simply pulse pounding. A couple games they could have done more with in the areas they were in but those parts are still executed greatly. The4 first game with the doll is also wild and the twist is fantastic. Also other scenes where no game is being played are crazy well done. The show gets disturbing and shocking. The production design and costume design is also fantastic. Squid Game is such wild stuff.",,,
A decent show but don't believe the hype. It was just ok at best. Overall I think the plot was a great idea but just executed poorly in some instances. The acting is way over top and the show goes downward after the first 6 episodes.,,,
Fantastically original and engaging show. Deserved to become the world wide phenomenon it did.,,,
"The acting is some of the best acting ever put to screen. The cinematography, the writing, the directing, the metaphors, the subtext. Everything about this show is suburb. Also a smart critique on Capitalism that lays its points across very well. Many will say, ""oh it's not against Capitalism, how dare you be against Capitalism, what are you a Communist?"" Then I say to you that you missed the entire point of the show. The point to showcase the flaws in a system that plays itself off as ""everyone is treated fairly"" when everyone clearly is not (based on that twist in the finale). To point out these flaws to bring them to light is not to be against the idea in question, but to show that we need to work on it. This show pushes you to reconsider what is fair in life, what life means to you, and what you may be willing to do to help your loved ones. This series will go down in history among television's finest. And with no many networks looking for the next ""Game of Thrones success level,"" sorry to say that Netflix has beaten you to the punch by letting filmmaker Hwang Dong-hyuk, 황동혁, tell the story he has wanted to tell for the better part of a decade.",,,
"Top shelf and worth the hype. Intelligent, gripping, moving, well written, beautifully cast and acted, and most of all, says so much about the human condition while being nail biting. No one does human drama mixed with social commentary quite like South Koreans.",,,
"An expectation-defying Netflix series after the two disappointing and boring Netflix series ""Dark"" and ""The Queen's Gambit"", Squid Game really keeps you glued to the screen. It's compelling, often unpredictable, it ends well, it's nearly perfect.",,,
"Asian film production companies are very skilled at bringing original material to the viewing public. If American production companies took more risks with new material we wouldn't have to keep reproducing successful TV series and films from other countries. I'm pleased to see the original creations becoming popular in America without being ""Americanized"" I love this series and sooo many more. People should definitely check out more films and series from overseas. The stories they come up with are mind blowing!",,,
I like this new idea of the squad game series ... I like it very much ... best foreign TV series I have ever watched. 9 /10 A must watch,,,
Overall it is an entertaining watch with the peak being episode 6. Unfortunately twists come at the cost of the emotion felt throughout. I will be tuning in for season 2 though so that is something.,,,
"It's hard to rate this one because from one side the show is good, thrilling and unique. But from the opposite it feels a little ""cheap"", blood and murder for the greed of money. Like, where can you go wrong?",,,
That ending ruined it.,,,
"Fun,Brutal and emotionally entertaining! the concept and games were amazing and the character and there families fate decided with such deaths made it so terrifying and brilliant, The ending was satisfying Overall it was a Great season!",,,
"When Squid Game got released, I was rather sceptical about the entire series. I started watching, but I realized right after the tug of war episode (episode 4), that I couldn't stop watching! What made me return was not the interest of seeing who'll win, rather catching all of the little details, that originally pulled my attention towards the series. By analyzing the deeper meaning behind music-choice and the use of color/shapes, the three simple rules the game made them follow (that meant a lot more to the story, than what meets the eye), the many easter eggs indicating that this game is not a ""one time event""... The character development, as well as the use of foreshadowing is extraordinary! I simply can't wait for season 2 (officially confirmed). Hopefully the writer doesn't mess this up, as he originally spent 12 years bringing the first season to life...",,,
"WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T!!! Ignore ALL the negative reviews, this is a show I feel like anyone would be interested in. I'm tired of the repetitive plots, boring endings, and unnecessary romance that seem to pop up often in other shows. There is a reason why squid game has been the most watched show in all of Netflix by far! Every character is interesting in their own way. With my low-attention span, I usually skip slow scenes, but not with squid game. The plot is so original and interesting, not many people would expect it. It is sad that basically all the main/interesting characters have died but for 2-3, so I'm not sure if the second season will match up, but the first season made squid game become one of my favorite shows of all time.",,,
"Squid Game has one annoying characters and some questionable choices here and there, but it is a riveting, socially relevant and brutal experience that has you consistently hooked with well-written characters and solid production.",,,
"Disturbing and terrible overdubbing voice acting, but somehow entertaining and mesmerizing all the same.",,,
Very good tv show full of new ideas and twists. Absolute pleasure to watch.,,,
"It did amazing with its story and the writing is pretty good!! The pacing is good and the characters are also good. 1x6 is the best episode because of its shocking moments and incredible writing, but the rest of the episodes are generally just ""good"" nothing more then that! Though episode 1 does have amazing thrill moments and excitingness the rest don't exceed 8/10 that much. Pretty good series!!",,,
"I know the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, but I was still surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did. I laughed. I cried. I cried a LOT, but it still blew my mind.",,,
"While this show is very dark, it draws your attention constantly and always makes you want to watch the next episode immediately. All the characters are very easy to connect to and to get behind. This show really makes you think about human nature and what you would do in these people's situations.",,,
"Sheer Brilliance. The show can feel a little slow at times in the first half of the season, but otherwise it's a well written, well executed show that succeeds on every front.",,,
"It was a sensation for a reason. I didn't want to be influenced by the hype- but Squid Game deserves it. Whoa! I haven't been this engrossed since Stranger Things Season One. Impeccable plot and story. Nearly perfect sets and world-building. Dialogue and direction incredible. So amazing! Simple concept, but great execution.",,,
Overrated in my opinion but it wasn't terrible.,,,
"""The Squid Game"" was such a buzz this fall and had such an obsessive popularity and citation everywhere that I had to leave my scheduled list of series for a while to watch it. And to begin with, I will say that I am a viewer in this genre is extremely inexperienced. I haven't watched Battle Royale, or the Hunger Games, or even Jigsaw. This series actually became for me the first work with a similar concept, although I knew about it earlier, of course. All my impressions of this series should be considered from this point of view. And I loved the series! Yes, given how unoriginal it is and that the films I listed in the previous paragraph could very well be better, this show may not deserve the crazy attention it's been receiving over the last month. Yes, everything is far from perfect in it, this is not a masterpiece and not a brilliant series - it has a lot of jambs, ranging from implausibility and illogicality (it was hard for me personally to believe that hundreds of adults would voluntarily agree to a frankly deadly game for the sake of a dubious ghostly gain, even and cosmic sum) and ending with flat, stupid and vile characters, most of which are not worked out at all. Among them is the main character, who is so disgusting in the first series that because of him it's even hard to watch it before the start of the game itself. More or less deep and controversial character is only a childhood friend of the protagonist. It was interesting for me to watch him, but, alas, no one else. The series is also pretty predictable. Almost all the plot moves in it are easily guessed. The only thing that could really surprise me was the final twist, but it was only needed to start the second season, which I am sure will be, because most of the questions in the first season were not answered. However, Korean films and series are now in vogue, and therefore they are forgiven for secondary and some other shortcomings. The monosyllabic nature of the characters is leveled by the entertainment of the games, which are in the first place here and are made very high quality. The series has a pleasant visual, it is comfortable to watch, in terms of style, a good soundtrack, and the plot as a whole manages to drag out, no matter what. I think it's definitely worth spending time and getting acquainted with the main hit of this fall, especially if you are as unwatched a viewer of this genre as I am. I definitely got the pleasure of watching, although I didn't remain completely delighted, and I look forward to continuing! Koreans know how to please.",,,
I mean like yeah pretty much!!!!!!!:) give us the season 2 now!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,
"Good show, a little overrated. I enjoyed it, but there was a lot less ""Squid Game"" than I was expecting. There were some good twists and turns, though nothing super original. What stood out to me most, as an American viewer, were the truly terrible dubs.",,,
"I would have given this 5 stars because it keeps you absolutely glued, but there isn't a single redeemable character in the entire story. Just an utterly fascinating and fun series about a lot of really bad people. ROFL, I can't wait for season 2.",,,
SQUID GAME is a Series with Extremely Intense Scenes that Makes you Sweat while watching it...,,,
"Probably enjoyable if you can't tell good and bad writing apart. Otherwise it's the dumbest, most pointless show you'll ever see.",,,
"This show is the first K-Thriller that made it big time, does it deserve it? Yes and no. Yes, because this show like other shows keeps you glued to your seat throughout the entire show and leaves you worried about the main character's life, which not many shows can do. No, because the acting isn't the best and the story can go over the top in particular scenes (The VIP Scene). Overall this show is overhyped but not overrated.",,,
"I really enjoyed it. A critique of modern life? capitalism? human nature? reality tv? South Korea? Also, some very good performances.",,,
"Much like some of Bong Joon-ho's films, such as Mother, Okja, and Parasite, Squid Game offers a captivating and stylish depiction of its core theme, particularly the consequences of socioeconomic inequality.",,,
"It took me a long time to watch this show because of how mainstream it was, but all I'll say is that it exceeded all my expectations and lived up to the hype. It was original, energetic, captivating, and I very much do not want a second season.",,,
Over hyped. Or at least it was back when it came out. The first couple of episode were really great but it slowly went down hill. The ending was okay. Overall theres better and also worse shows. If you wish to watch it then watch with sub instead of dub. the dubbing for the show sucks,,,
A once-in-a-generation series.,,,
"I tried to reposition my expectation and hopes with each episode. However, it is really disappointing from beginning to end. This is really overrated and also full of mischief. The point tho must go to the 'hard' work on branding, designing and marketing those 'brain-washing' like symbolic that almost capture people's minds in ""you have to watch it and it is awesome"" mode. Unbelievable, hope the next season is better than selling the image of the ideology. But to really work on the ideology problem in society.",,,
It's hype it's totally worth it. Very original series (may have taken the idea for Saw saga but nothing to worry abouet). Amazing plot and great performance.,,,
"Funny and original!!!!!!!!!! From South Korea, LOL.",,,
"Squid Game brings to Netflix a thriller induced game that shows true meaning of being betrayed, lied to and broken inside. If you want only the action then you will be waiting awhile before you find it but it still holds together an amazing story and plot twist.",,,
"Good season, heard the hype so checked it out, wasn't as good as i was lead to believe but still pretty solid. Good writing looking forward to season 2",,,
"I thought this would be a show trying to shock us with contestants undergoing a series of violent games. There is that, but there is also a lot more to it. The games become increasingly psychological and cruel. The contestants have interesting and engaging back stories, and you really start to feel for many of them. In the end I'm not sure the ultimate message – some of the contestants are people who fell through the cracks of society, others are psychopaths – but it's an interesting and engaging ride.",,,
So not what I expected. Shocking and fascinating at the same time. Great story telling and great Korean actors. I am looking forward to season 2!,,,
"Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it. It was entertaining even though the end was somewhat predictable a few episodes before the end. Some good performance by a few of the Korean actors/actresses. Korean drama usually casts very mediocre actors in the non-Korean roles (e.g. the VIPs). Ho Yeon Jung captivates very scene she is in. Anticipate a second season",,,
It is a fantastic movie I loved it the characters were amazing but the only thing I did not like about it was the ending it was terrible the ending could have been so much better but instead it was what I saw other than that it was good and I would watch it again,,,
"uuuufff.... that was a lot. But a great writing. Went to it completely in the dark so I wasn't expecting so much gore BUT nevertheless, was amazing.",,,
Haven't met anyone who hasn't enjoyed this.,,,
Squid Game is an awesome show with a great cast. I love the cast and the show is suprisingly dark and emotional. A must see show.,,,
"I HATE SUBTITLES! Watch this anyway it's totally worth reading. ""There's never anything new! Just rehashes of the same old stuff."" - everybody ""Here ya go."" - Squid Game",,,
"really good, such a fresh tv show, loved the different storylines",,,
"What do you look for in a good show? The plot? Meh. The characters? Mostly cartoonish. The political statement? Heavy-handed. Interesting ways of killing people? Ok, I'll give them that.",,,
There are too many scenes that remind me of the death game movies that already exist.,,,
"honestly, i was a bit disappointed.",,,
Amazing up to the last half hour.,,,
"Doesn't live up to the hype. Couldn't make it past episode 3. Once you've seen The Hunger Games, this show just doesn't measure up.",,,
Couldn't get enough of this. Watch it in Korean with subtitles as the dubbing is dreadful.,,,
Another tired idea disguised as something original for every American viewer who has never seen a Korean made film before. It's not bad or anything but I can't help but laugh at the people who are so blown away and invested in this show. Welcome to something other than the Friends episode you have seen 100 times before.,,,
"I can't believe this slow, boring, predictable show full of bad (typically Asian) overacting and clumsily written criticism of capitalism had the success it did. South Korean and Japan really still have a lot of catching up to do in terms of creating art that's relevant and fresh. The success of this series probably says more about the strange glorification of very mediocre or even bad art by teenage Western nerds who only know video games and Marvel movies. It 100% lives on the ""exoticism bonus"" that any dumb thing from Korea (and Japan) will receive.",,,
"everyone at my school was talking about this show and saying it was good, and they weren't wrong its really good. the show has a great suspense, and the gore was also something that really made me love the show even more. the acting from everyone here is amazing, and way better than I expected. This show was almost made me cry in one of the episodes as it started to get heated because only one person can win in this show, and that means some the main characters have to die. The thing that really ruins it are the VIP people that get introduced near the end of the show, literally all they say is 69, and 96.",,,
"el juego del calamar aparte de ser una serie sangrienta y sádica con una dinámica muy entretenida , refleja lo crudo que es el mundo.",,,
"A program that like most Korean television tugs at the heartstrings and makes emotions the main character over the game show and entertainment its brings. There was a lot of hype around this and that normally can put me off due to having my expectations too high, this wasn't the case with this. thoroughly surprised me at times and was really enjoyable.",,,
Once they started playing the games I couldn't stop watching!,,,
"Good, but overhyped. Really enjoyed the characters and set design, but I don't think it offered much of anything new other than what was already mentioned. I guess I would have been happier with a more elaborate ending reveal.",,,
"The most brazenly disgusting TV series ever. Irredeemably violent Snuff-Porn for the brain-dead dopamine addicts and facebook zombies of the world. This gratuitous, slickly packaged mayhem, interspersed with patronizing, emotional ""human"" moments conning you into thinking there's some kind of societal ""message"" within, could've been depicted in 1 episode. At the end you're left with nothing — except the reassurance you've profited the production company and further rotted what's left of your putrefying synapses and morality.",,,
"This show was great, amazing to watch the first time, and would love to see a sequel as long as it does not become a repeat of the first season.",,,
"Perfect storytelling which keeps you attached to the screen for the whole series. The theme itself though and the possible sequel make it a bit too messy, but still a great show. Possibly the best of 2021.",,,
"This show is a breath of fresh air. I loved how it really isn't about the games, but rather the characters. In just a few episodes you really dive deep into their emotions and motivations.",,,
squind gam I like. h,,,
"Impactante y con juegos bastante entretenidos, pero pudo haber sido más corta, su final fue muy aburrido ya que se dedico a ser un preámbulo para la segunda temporada, pero eso no echa a perder esta serie cargada de suspenso.",,,
"The show brings together a lot of intriguing concepts that work together to develop the plot. By developing mystery and intrigue, it successfully tells a story about the theme that money isn't everything.",,,
Tension and violence juxtaposed with humour make for a wonderful series. Lee Jung Jae proves his acting prowess with the perfectly complex Gi Hun.,,,
"This series is awesome! The characters are well built and the plot is fantastic. Every moment that we think will be a cliché scene, the show changes our vision and surprises us.",,,
To be honest it took me awhile to cave into the hype of this series; I didn't even have it on my Netflix que until this first week of January after some relatives encouraged me to watch it; knowing that they wouldn't normally do that unless it was really something extraordinary. This show just really got to me. It does a fine job of establishing the characters that you can really connect to and care about; and you're at the edge of your seat hoping they'll pull through until the end. I am certainly looking forward to what the next season has in store!,,,
"Anyone who says Squid Game sucks, I'm so sorry to say that they don't have any knowledge and don't know what the hell are they talking.",,,
"One of the best shows of 2021. Creative and interesting, although still a little overhyped.",,,
"Eu gosto mais nao acho ela incrível e uma serie boa nao otima,a serie tem um ritimo bom mais acho que ser perde la para o final",,,
"Intriguing concept, though it was mostly a reboot of Hunger Games. The series spent far too much time on the minutiae of the characters' interaction with one another. It would have been far more intriguging had the organization behind the games been a larger focus--for instance, who are the VIPs? How are they selected? How was the island constructed? All answers we don't get. I came away angry for having spent so much time on it.",,,
Exquisitely written - morally and creatively orchestrated.,,,
"I will give it a nearly perfect score. But at the end, I am not sure I understand the point the old man said, he arranged the game to see if the people had humanity. But how do you bring out the best in people by killing all of them. If they all would of helped each other in the games, most of them would still die.",,,
Definitely among my top 3 tv shows of 2021.,,,
"This was excellent by all means. I always say, indie films are much much much better than mainstream pictures (esp. Asian originated productions whose storylines are usually way better thought-out than their Western counterparts). Likewise, I usually gauge such indie films/tv shows with more thorough standards. That said, Squid Game was exemplary. The story is original though not entirely new to any prolific movie/book lover - many ideas in the series can be traced back to a number of anime and books I've read. This still does not take away the finesse of the product that is this show. I just hope that they do not make a sequel and instead limit it to a one-season show.",,,
Four stars and half 31/12/2021,,,
"Squid Game is a good series, but overrated. His drama is not, in my opinion, so well constructed and most characters have artificial personalities. Besides, its ending was, honestly, unnecessary.",,,
"Skip episode 1 , boring as hell but if you give the series a chance it gets nuts in episode 2 .",,,
"Serie sensacional. Passa uma mensagem interessante, e prende sua atenção no inicio ao fim.",,,
"Entretenida y frenética en un principio, pero no es capaz de sostener ese ritmo a lo largo de la temporada, las subtramas son irrelevantes para el desarrollo de la serie y varias se quedan en la nada misma, el final es todo lo contrario al inicio de la misma siendo anticlimatico y argumentalmente inestable.",,,
Interesting idea but badly made! Moviemaking for dummies...,,,
The story and its characters are gorgeously/viciously/tragically woven together to bring out an incredible masterpiece. I have watched it twice and cried both times.,,,
"It expresses the psychology of various people well, and moreover, it was fun because the games of childhood reminded me of memories.",,,
"Didn't quite stick the landing, but otherwise a fantastic ride.",,,
"A solid thriller series, that is sadly brought down by the MC deciding he is Liam Neeson's ""Taken"" character in the final moments, which not only goes against what he was trying to achieve from the beginning, but ruins any final bonding moments with his daughter. Overall 90% of the show is entertaining and thriller though, but do I want a season 2? Not really.",,,
"Fantastic. Very good acting, well thought plot, congratulations to the director, he planned this for 9 years.",,,
"In a time where shallow cash grabs dominate the entertainment industry, this thrilling and well-told story deserves a lot of respect. The concept was creative and fresh. The character arcs were complete and satisfying. The symbolism was on point. Every episode was more exciting than the last.",,,
"Starts quick enough to keep your attention, and once you get sucked in, it's hard to quit watching. This is one of the few shows I've gone into knowing nothing about, and came away glad I stumbled upon it. It's very brutal and not for the faint of heart, but its very creative and entertaining.",,,
"It was ok. Extremely predictable with basic, unlikeable characters, complete with unnecessary storylines.",,,
"Suspensful, dramatic, Gory. If you watch horror anime genre its a similar feeling and style. Glad to see more extreme concepts in a live action show.",,,
"Very overhyped…. But if your going to watch it, watch it in its original language for a more realistic feel.",,,
Thoughts here are the wildest it's interesting how people can kill and die for money the concept is on a whole other level,,,
Was hard to finish but I did. After I watched it - it gave me depression for a week. Do we really need to make those series so people understand what's wrong with the world? Isn't it obvious?? And super sad … Kids shouldn't watch this sh.t,,,
"Poor, unoriginal, predictable, and pretty much where we are heading",,,
"I watched this in fast forward to get through it. It was like watching big brother or survivor with good acting, which didn't save it but know that I give big brother and survivor negative stars.",,,
Satire on the abuses of capitalism and the desperation people exhibit to get out of debt is not a subject you'd think would make a good show. This series from Korea is worth seeing. The truth of the matter is everyone has their own ability and worth but that is often lost in the murky waters of priorities in wealth and money that others set for us. The personal interactions between the players is what makes this show worth watching. It is a parable about life as much as it is a parable about choices and consequences.,,,
"Fun, fresh, surprisingly well acted. Despite surreal plot, felt real and moving. And of course, it didn't allow to get bored even for one minute.",,,
"An entertaining critique on wealth inequality in our modern world. Characters find themselves in a place in life where the almost certainty of death is worth a slim chance at having wealth. Character backstories and interactions pull at your heart strings, all the while these struggles are contrasted by the calculated coldness of the game's overseers. Reflected in this microcosm are the modernist virtues of self-value being derived solely from one's product and the systematic dehumanization of the impoverished for the benefit of the wealthy. Ultimately not perfect, but very pertinent and with enough twists and turns to keep the audience engaged and keep the ball rolling.",,,
"It starts out slow and cheesy, but picks up as the show goes on with a genuinely emotional few episodes farther in. At the end of the day, though, it's pulpy blood sport for the masses to consume, and consume it they did.",,,
"Besides the German series ""Dark"", this is the only other show I've watched from Netflix that's actually legit. The fact that it was another foreign-based psychological thriller from a different country (Korea, in this case), amazed me. From episode 1, you're thrown into a feeling of suspense and haste. It's got a fast-pace vibe before the subsequent episodes allow you to explore true nature and quality of characters. Betrayals and alliances are to be expected in this Battle Royale inspired series. The sick sadomasochist flamboyant corporate elite who pay to watch innocent poor folks torture themselves for a prize is reflective of the dark society we live in our day and age. Brilliant stuff. Unfortunately, I don't think it makes sense to add a season 2. This should be a stand alone series. I'm not sure how they'd develop a season 2 when it ended the way should end.",,,
"Crazy. Widely ranging actor performances from understated calm (contestant No.1) to wild over the top (Gi-Hun). Random shock brutality with the mystique of the game is the draw card. Couldn't stop watching. And what exactly is the ""Inspector Royale""?",,,
"Don´t get the hype. It was an ""ok"" show. Nothing special about it.",,,
It is a shocker and has this gripping effect in the First Episode that keeps you glued until the Last waiting for more. Ending in my opinion could have been different!,,,
"Impressed by the creative flow and the depth of the story. Yet the moment the 'foreign guests' started to talk, I thought I was watching some English-teaching program.",,,
Surprising good. Was not even going to watch. Glad i gave it a chance.,,,
Whats all the craze about this? Its really not that great its nothing special overrated asf,,,
"I watched this show because everyone wouldn't shut up about it! I found it quite entertaining, mostly at first, and while I do think it's worth watching I think it's kinda overrated.",,,
I expected more because the hype. Good script and drama. But the final scramble the hole show.,,,
Excellent and refreshing.,,,
"Really top-notch and riveting show. The art direction is what makes it first and foremost. It's like watching an art piece. There is some laudable acting in some scenes. The level of violence takes some getting used to and is a bit of a turn-off. There are also some really terrible parts to the show (the most memorable being the VIP episode). Lots of complexity, good length, good characters. Not perfect.",,,
It's very difficult to watch it from the beginning to the end. The violence is somehow unpleasantly highlighted. But the story is good.,,,
"Brutal soft-core murder porn in a social commentary wrapper. There were other ways to tell this story without the grotesque bloodshed, but they chose to go the violent route to attract the guns & gore set. Not the sort of titillation we need in these times, already ugly and cruel enough without endless shots of bullets entering foreheads, sprays of blood and bodies collapsing to the ground.",,,
"The amount of plot holes in this show is unfathomable, and the notion that the protagonist is a useless father and gambler, made me want to kill him myself, nevermind the games. I could not root for the main character, I couldn't care if he lived or died.",,,
"The best part of the show, for me, was the design. Loved the outfits of the soldiers, and the grand-scale contests with playground and video game-inspirations. The sheer number of deaths was a little much, especially early on, but the show was done well enough that I stayed emotionally engaged for most of the episodes.",,,
Really loved the cast. I get a little bored with predictability but worth watching!,,,
Binge-worthy edge-of-your-seat stuff from start to finish. Not for the faint hearted.,,,
"Shocking, thrilling, and underlined with a perfect score - but the final episode was a disappointment.",,,
"Man, this show was so well done!",,,
Average story sprinkled with some very touching moments.,,,
Started watching and couldn't stop. One of the most entertaining shows I've seen in a while.,,,
"After the initial slow start, the show was quite good. While the concept itself is interesting, the real strengths for me were the characters and the emotional trauma they have to go through. After some very hard hitting mid to late season episodes, sadly the ending failed to deliver – opting to rather set up a season 2, than deliver a rounded off story.",,,
"While the overall storyline and acting was good, it certainly wasn't as good as most people made it to be, especially not for all the attention it got. The first episode was too slow, too long and the same goes for some of the other episodes.",,,
"There are some minor pacing and structural problems, a little bit too much gross-out for my tastes at points, and the English-speaking VIPs are very cringe (but it's hard to direct and act across a language barrier during production), but this is overall a masterful production. The actors' performances are superb (except in the English dub), the set and costume design is incredible, the music is excellent, the editing is great. Not any kind of revolutionary story, we've seen it before, its themes are a bit overhyped, but this is simply a good, simple story told well. Excellent work to everyone involved.",,,
pretty good for a show with an overused concept.,,,
"The American's watching over the games in one of the later episodes was pretty terrible and detracted a little from being fully immersed in what would be a nightmare of an experience, plus a relatively predictable ending for who wins the games didn't throw many curveballs at the unexpecting audience. Although the big reveal at the end certainly was not expected, and left a fairly good open end for another season. Too bad most Korean shows rarely progress past 1 series",,,
"I'm sorry I'm not aboard this hype train, what utter junk this series is.",,,
"mrbeast watched episodes 6-9 of this show and then went ""yeah i should do this irl"". i dont hate him but that is some psycho shit honestly",,,
Amazing piece of art,,,
"Stale, predictable plot further polluted by extreme, nauseating violence",,,
One of my favorites of all time. Amazing writing and storyline that goes deep. Excited for season 2 and even more excited to rewatch season 1.,,,
Really great show. Actors did a wonderful job.,,,
Excellent! Highly recommned,,,
"This show is amazing, top to bottom. I legitimately can't find any real flaws.",,,
"I really loved this idea! It was fun to watch and really got me hooked to the point where I had to binge watch it. The overall plot and outcome of the series makes you really think about what people will ultimately do when they are desperate or feel they have 0 to lose. I can't wait for season 2! To me, The acting was also really great and the characters were very believable (but this is also a foreign culture so in all truth I likely don't have enough understanding of South Korea to fairly say that) mainly in terms of how they conveyed desperation from their life circumstances. I highly recommend! So entertaining!",,,
Just Wow !! this is the best show on Netflix.,,,
"It's ok. It's like a merge of ""Liar game"" and ""Btoom!"" I kinda hoped there will be ""wolf among sheeps"" theme like in ""Doubt"". +Some interesting takes. -Some things are inconsistent.",,,
Can't wait for the next season,,,
Thought provoking How much does a soul cost?,,,
So good! Binged it all night. Can not wait for season 2!,,,
All around a pretty good show I was able to binge watch the whole thing front to back and will watch a second season if released. It was unique with plot twist action comedy and loads of drama solid 8/10,,,
"First episode made me want the main character to die. Last episode strengthened that feeling. I don't care if they are trying to present a political message. He did everything for a chance to spend time with his daughter, and then abandoned her for strangers (most of which are horrible people) when he had everything he could dream of.",,,
"Just the concept of the series is trash. A bunch of Korean people playing kid-games for a lot of money, and if someone fails the game, they get shot to death. So maybe that's me, I don't like the storyline. But also, in my opinion, the acting wasn't great either. Probably one of the worst series I've ever seen.",,,
Overhyped and overrated. If this is on your to-watch list: only watch this when you really have nothing else left to watch. Don't believe the hype.,,,
"I have one word for this series: overrated. Yes, although the plot is okay, the characters show marvelous acting, I think some parts just don't fit right. Kudos to the Netflix team in Korea, definitely worth passing the time, but not worth rewatching. I give 3 stars to this.",,,
"Thought provoking, creative visual set design, emotional attachment to characters... a well done series. Very violent and highly do not recommend for kids under 15.",,,
"Amazing idea, amazing storytelling!!! The ending was a bit meh tho many parts are very emotional and I cried At some points too harsh for my personal taste but so well made!",,,
Pretty great all around,,,
"I found this incredibly disturbing to watch, but the storyline of the main characters gets you hooked and you end up binging episodes just to find out what's going on and how it will end. Needless to say, I have been left extremely unsettled after watching this...I don't think my stomach can handle another season if there is going to be one. Overall, the production deserves a thumbs up - filming, acting and character developments were fantastic.",,,
I do not understand the fascination with this. It's a series of hyperbolic statements. Hated it. Acting is OK.,,,
Doesn't live up to the hype. Cheap storyline.,,,
Fantastic action and suspense.,,,
"I enjoyed the games and the ideas behind what the show was attempting, however, I found the acting horrendous and the dubs even more so. Somone point me to auditions for voice acting because I would blow away the dubbing competition on this one.",,,
"I think there's something very ironic about a series made with such a strong anti-capitalist message being owned and distributed by one of the largest media corporations in the world and then going on to become a huge hit, thereby enriching said corporation. With that in mind, the message of Squid Game, to me, felt pointless.",,,
Squid Game is an awesome show! And I highly recommend it. 90%,,,
"I understand why people can love this, but it as just too violent for me. The story was okay, but not flawless at parts with many conventional elements, the acting was alright, and just one more thing: why is the English dub so bad? There isn't a dub in my native language, but for most movies and series we have dubs and they are way better than this.",,,
"I HATED the protagonist, but I had to finish it. Addictive, if frustrating experience.",,,
Such disregard to a human life for a sake of a kids game in a movie borns rejection to watch it.,,,
"Such an awesome watch from start to finish. The Second episode felt jarring while watching it in real time, But by the end it paid off in full. The Plot progression was intriguing all the way through and some team ups & betrayals were expected but most came out of the blue. The heart wrenching 6th episode was beautifully done, with all 3 main storylines. The plot twist of second last episode was just mundane & nothing surprising and for what was an awesome streak of subversion starting with 1st episode & the more so the second episode all the way through, It felt like a let down. The ending plot twist or reveal was also something I wasn't fond of at first but thinking & recollecting some earlier stuff that happened turned me around on it, but talking about the series as a whole, I would say it exceeded my expectations & then some.",,,
"Stylish, if brutal stuff. This years standout TV.",,,
"Squid Game takes viewers on a journey meant to hook our neurochemistry like a drug. On an almost metered-out basis, Squid Game consistently packs on violence and shock like clockwork. As a result, the series ironically feels like Netflix's psychologically manipulative answer to social media algorithms keeping our attention through intermittent dopamine release. This is ironic, because Squid Game paints a dystopian world in which capitalism manipulates and allegorically places people in a scenario akin to the Hunger Games. It portrays the terrifying, never-ending black hole of debt as a violent and deadly game. I appreciate the allegory, which spans a complex set of social conditions and implicates brutal Capitalism; however, it also places a mirror before the creators of this monstrosity: the show itself manipulates our minds. By intermittently ramping up our emotions, it draws people in. One secret to this show's success isn't its apt painting of a capitalist dystopia; it's that the show itself manipulates you to keep watching by triggering strong emotions. Even Netflix has gotten into the game of influencing our minds and keeping our attention, like Facebook and Twitter. This is why Squid Game deserves one-half of a star: it relies on an unethical and emotionally manipulative science (which I could argue is mental abuse) serving capitalist interests to keep us watching. On a deeper level, while I can verify that this show is well-directed and intriguing, its deepest element-- an allegory of brutal capitalism and today's social forces-- is derivative. The Platform and Hunger Games, more recently, reflect some of its themes. Unbearable violence accents their points. In Squid Game, its characters are generally unlikable, while somewhat real. I do like that social obligations and cultural obligations like family find themselves in conflict with Capitalism-- a unique part of this show. Still, it can't redeem this show from the underlying capitalist goal to manipulate our minds. This could have been so much better done without the metered-out psychological hook of extreme violence. (And the violence is EXTREME.)",,,
I really enjoyed it completely unexpected that I would even like this but it was so good,,,
"Fantastic show, truly unexpected and very entertaining",,,
"Is it a bad show? No. Is it original? No. If you haven't seen Battle Royale or the Saw franchise, you'll like this show. If you have, it's pretty predictable.",,,
This show is amazing. Red Light Green Light can catch you off guard and sets the pace for the entire show. Very entertaining concept.,,,
"Pretty much a big copy of Kaiji but it was alright. If you have seen the anime or read the book, this is going to feel like a cheap knockoff and the twists are identical. Starts a bit slow but once you get to the games it's fun. I'd recommend it to people who haven't seen the anime it's clearly copying (likely without the consent of the Japanese author).",,,
A bit hyped but not to bad. I have seen better series.,,,
"It doesn't reinvent the wheel if you watch anime on a regular basis, you already saw something similar (say hello to Kaiji ;). But it's very well done, it obviously had a good budget. No more drama than necessary, I had a fun time watching it.",,,
Very different but I had to keep watching.,,,
5 stars for everything. Netflix should avoid making dumb films like Red Notice and invest those money for TV shows like this,,,
Refreshing show. Recommendation.,,,
"Mind Blowing! I can't wait for more. Amazing things from South Korea lately, hope they keep them coming!",,,
amazing show - had me gripped throughout the whole season - please give us more,,,
Go watch Alice In Borderland . Squid games lacks edge and excitement . Squid games is predictable and lacks Energy and edge.,,,
"Really enjoyed season 1, Each episode brought something new and kinda surprising . Since the first episode it kept me guessing",,,
Good for a binge watch. Korean hunger games.,,,
"Gripping, thrilling, poignant, and on-point social commentary. Really enjoyable show to watch. Only negative I saw was the writing/acting for some American characters was laughably bad. That horrible writing/acting provided some good laughs, though.",,,
"Lame rip-off of ""Alice in Borderland"".",,,
Great cast and theme but it's not hype-worthy.,,,
"This is a mediocre show at best. Very overrated! It's possible that the dialogue may be lost in translation, but the translated dialogue is mundane & goofy & the acting is bad. I normally prefer subtitles, however the acting and dialogue is so bad that no quality is lost by watching this with dubs. While not entirely original, the premise is an interesting one, however they did not capitalize on it well. The Squid Games were as uncreative as humanly possible and I couldn't help but think throughout the show… no wealthy clientele would front money to see this. The only reason why it's mildly entertaining from our perspective is because we're following some of the characters involved before and during the Squid Games. On a side note, they made the lead character way too much of a jerk out of the gate, since he's supposed to be a sympathetic protagonist. Also, the storyline with the cop was nonsensical and didn't work well with the story. Overall this is a mildly entertaining show and is only recommended if you have nothing else to watch.",,,
surprisingly well written and acted. Hunger games meets Saw with the sentimentality of a character driven mini-series/film.,,,
Frakking amazing!! A definite must see!,,,
Nothing short of a masterpiece.,,,
"Great production value, innovative enough, though it drops off at the latter half of the show and its writing becomes weak.",,,
"Sucks. Cheap thrills, very little action, cheesy script. I suppose, though, it's a reliable indicator of the crap people will love if given the opportunity.",,,
It's a cool show but I don't get the hype about it...,,,
"One of the Best SF & F genre shows ever, and indeed one of the best TV shows ever",,,
Its good but dont know how it took off as much as it did,,,
"So many twists and turns and yet, the story never strays from the main point. The Cast worked well together and the set pieces were very (in a way) Nostalgic. The fact that this show has become a worldwide phenomenon is not a surprise to me. All in all, I highly suggest people watch it. However, I will add a bloody violence warning to it if you're the type of person that doesn't like this kind of content. All in all, I Give it 4 Stars.",,,
"Surprisingly very good and excellent story telling, never imagined I would be recommending a badly dubbed Korean TV programme, but one of the most original shows of 2021 and a real emotional ride at times.",,,
"I went into this show not expecting to enjoy it. I am happy to say that, after I turned off the irritating dub and watched in Korean with English sub, it was rather enjoyable. While quite a few of the plot beats are rather predictable, the writers manage to make what would be very unlikable people into sympathetic characters who you will root for.",,,
"A great show, but not without its faults. Check out ""Alice in Borderland""",,,
"It's very good but like others said, it doesn't deserve the hype. There are much better (Korean) shows out there.",,,
"Basically unwatchable. It is so cringe, cheap sets, bad actors, bad dialog. And just sooo unlikable characters.",,,
"Dont get better than this, must watch!",,,
Overrated af. Just saying.,,,
I never agree with Lebron James but he was right about the ending of this series. I also don't think that this show needs a second season.,,,
"Interesting premise, brilliant watch. Well worth the time! Not really keen on the ending but it makes sense! All in all watch, think, enjoy!",,,
"Strange show that tries very hard to be a social commentary. The idea is fun yet disturbing. Somewhat like SAW with more story and purpose. I really wanted this to be even less serious and almost like a cartoon. I didn't want to care for the characters because they are introduced as low lifes who have no control of their lives. I only wanted to watch the games and see who won. But, the show is much more dramatic than it had to be.",,,
I liked it except for the last two episodes. The writing wasn't so good anymore.,,,
Loved it but it doesn't deserve the hype. The cast should enjoy the hype while it lasts.,,,
"Good show, but the last episode was not good and the red wig was atrocious. I don't really care about a second season though.",,,
It's good but also completely overhyped.,,,
"A good TV series, somewhat predictable but it was enjoyable.",,,
"An entertaining survival thriller with an interesting conceit. Out of the many Korean series Squid Game has turned out to be the most popular in recent times and the main reason would be the simple yet interesting concept. It's not necessarily a novelty but survival drama with commentary on Capitalism is always a draw (The Platform, Battle Royale). The series uses this beautifully to connect us with the characters. The twists and surprises work mostly but some of them are quite predictable and especially the ""Front Man"" twist could be spotted from miles away. I did feel the final twist about the ""host"" wasn't effective and was there just to jolt us for one last time. The production design and direction were the highlights, the acting was solid. The dialogues, sometimes, felt redundant. Finally coming back to the social commentary on Capitalism, debt crisis, exploitation of the poor and globalisation, they all worked well into the screenplay despite being too obvious on a few places. All in all a good survival thriller that's worth watching. Is it one of the greats of the genre? Maybe not. But is it good? Absolutely!",,,
Amazing and original idea that will entretain you. My only flaw was the awful VIPS wich were very annoying.,,,
I rate this film half a star because i can't rate 0.,,,
"Better than I expected, but worse than others say about it. Predictable ending.",,,
"Some elements of the plot might not be fully appreciated, especially by western audiences, but it's undeniable that this series is one of the most memorable of the year.",,,
"Started off slowly. Got interesting in the middle. Disappointing climax/ending. Overall, OK.",,,
Way overrated. Couldnt get into it. Didnt care to see anymore,,,
deserved the hype it has,,,
"Like The Hunger Games for adults, set in present day, but does a better job of exploring the theme of economic desperation and a system designed to exploit that desperation for shallow purposes. A great script that doesn't need a big budget to be emotionally gripping.",,,
"It was a little predictable at time, but still good enough to keep me interested. There were a lot of sub plots that went annoyingly unanswered, like the police officer. Some of the acting was pretty bad, but those characters didn't have a lot of screen time, so it wasn't enough to ruin the show. Despite being a similar story to Hunger Games or Battle Royal, I felt this story was more relatable in that it was actual adults with adult issues.",,,
"Well, I guess everyone's already seen and reviewed this one. If you haven't watched SQUID GAME yet, what's wrong with you!? It's awesome. Then again, since there're already plans for season 2, don't worry about it if it doesn't interest you. A bunch of us will be watching this again before that season and (hopefully) will be watching the second season a few times also. Anyway, where's Stranger Things 4? This is a good supplement but it's no replacement.",,,
What else can I say that hasn't already been said? Did not see that coming. Wow!,,,
Really loved this show's themes of capitalism and empathy; the use of children's games was a very creative story function!!,,,
Great plot though somewhat too much 'drama' as usually found in Korean movies.,,,
"The concept of this series is amazing, and the message that leaves behind is incredible.",,,
"interesting, but one season was enough",,,
"Well shot , but i found it implausible script and sheer garbage for a canvass to have way over the top gore and violence. not my thing and honestly found it quite boring.",,,
"Lee Jung Jae's (Gi Hun) acting throughout the series was surreal, having the versatility and ability to convey visceral feelings of grief, joy, depression and anger made his character more compelling and sympathetic towards the audience. Sadly, Lee Jung Jae's character was the only one that had any development as majority of other characters felt underdeveloped and one dimensional only to serve as a emotional trigger for the audience, causing the final game/showdown to feel stale and uninteresting. The games themselves were brilliantly structured, achieving a great sense of tension and anxiety but still very entertaining. The cinematography felt familiar, having strong similarities at times to Stanley Kubrick but nothing new or special. The reoccurring motifs and symbolisms in the series makes it more thought provoking and rich in the way it makes the audience view the lower class and the diversity and separation in financial classes. The final scene felt forced and unrewarding as the directors or executive producers tried to force a sense tension for the build up of a unnecessary sequel. Possibly the hype that surrounded the Netflix Series made the it more disappointing as a whole.",,,
Phenomenon. Loving Netflix for bringing its subscribers all these wonderful foreign shows.,,,
"Almost 7 hours of boring clichés thrown together haphazardly. That was this series. The story is extremely linear and there are almost no twists in this entire series. While watching I started playing a guessing game of what was gonna happen next and I was right 100% of the time (well, except one time). The main cast was a mashup of the TV Tropes list of top 6 most common tropes. The main character, who is presented as a typical anti-hero and is given the typical anti-hero progression arc, is extremely boring. There's the typical comic relief character, the typical antagonist character and the typical tough girl sidekick character. There's also the token minority diversity character, who in this case was a Pakistani. Being Pakistani myself, this character is bordering on racism and even if that wasn't the case, it's full of weird inconsistencies (Pakistan is North of India? Maybe look at a map?). Also the character speaks in an Indian accent - which I found funny. The premise of the squid game itself is very overplayed at this point. It was cool when the hunger games came out, now it's boring. At best, this series is a half-assed attempt at a meta commentary on late-stage capitalism. The only interesting character in this entire series is the detective looking for his brother. The cliff scene at the end of the second last episode is the only time in this series when I was caught off guard by a plot twist. Too bad it didn't amount to much. The ending sets it up for a sequel, which might actually come considering this show's popularity (god knows why it's popular). I hope the sequel can redeem it, but I don't have my hopes up. Would have been 2 stars if they had kept the detective character alive. As it is, only 1 star.",,,
What a breath of fresh air.. tv can still be watchable and compelling,,,
"All the hype around Squid Game is definitely deserved, this story which serves as a metaphor for the rat race that is modern society is set to the backdrop of heavily indebted people being forced to play children's games for a cash prize and for their own lives. Each character we're introduced to bar a few are fully fleshed out and interesting, the intriguing premise and setting help to make it all the more interesting though this concept is not entirely new the spin taken on it in this series definitely is, I admire the fact that this show isn't afraid to show us characters that are all different shades of grey which helps to ground the world. The twists towards the end of the series are superb though I'm not completely satisfied with the very end and some characters who are introduced towards the end of the series, all in all I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend you go watch it.",,,
"An old idea regurgitated. I cant see why there is so much hype. The plot is pretty obvious, and not all the acting was credible.",,,
"O hype por trás da série não se justifica, com uma trama previsível, plots fracos, desafios injustos e filosofia brocochô a série não passa de uma cópia barata de alive in borderland que se supera em todos os aspectos!",,,
"Given the hype you'd be forgiven for expecting so much more. Its entertaining and certainly raises some interesting and difficult questions, but it is not a new story, and its not even the best told version. Worth a watch, but very predictable.",,,
"Very good, almost one of the best k-dramas.",,,
great but I think it's so overrated. people act like there is no better show than this and I had really high expectations because of that. I still think the concept is great but I am a bit disappointed,,,
"Although Squid Game contained lots of violence, gore, etc., it was a captivating show with a creative approach like none other. It contained many suspenseful twists which could never have been predicted, making it a must watch.",,,
This show is amazing! Riveting storyline and great acting. I couldn't stop watching and had to binge the entire show. We want more.,,,
"Una Copia descarada del Manga y Anime: KAIJI, se copia de muchas ideas originales y solo a las personas que no conocen estos ultimos les parece una maravilla, pero en realidad es una serie llena de plagios de otras fuentes",,,
An absolute masterpiece.,,,
"Although not every moment of this is as gripping as the next, it's hard not to be enthralled in the characters and narrative this show presents. Far from a perfect show, but nonetheless a highly recommendable experience. 8.1/10",,,
It is overrated a lot. I got bored in the 5th episode but I had to finish it so as to understand what everyone liked so much. I couldn't.... find sth. A lot of blood for no reason. Not worth to watch.,,,
"It's good but overrated. The story is new-ish and it is fun to watch, but it's not as incredible as everybody is saying. A good watch but nothing more. The photography, though, is incredible! The colors are very vibrant creating a great contrast with the events on screen.",,,
"I've seen MUCH better versions of this. Even Alice in Borderland was better than this. The first few episodes were good, then it got more boring as the season went on. SUPER predictable tho.",,,
"I am normally not into foreign films or tv shows, I've only seen a handful that I thought were good, but this one had me captivated. I thought it was well done and the story well told. Can't wait for season #2",,,
"Absolutely brilliant yet horrific way to show classism, capitalism and the depths of human nature and how far you're willing to go for money. Astonishing and a show I wont forget about any time soon. Every single actor and actress nailed their performances.",,,
excited for more new games and ideas.,,,
"I loved this show. I loved the characters, the plot, the design - especially after checking out the behind the scenes and rationale videos for the set! It might be a little predictable and some picky qualms but I don't care about any of that because I enjoyed it so much.",,,
"Over-hyped, predictable, so many questionable plot devices and loose ends. We're going to abduct and kill 450 people with families, leave our calling card lying around all over the place. Yeah. Had some interesting moments scattered across the nine episodes, which is why I score it as high as I have. Ending scene was a WTF moment.",,,
"A very fine portrayal of crucial social inequalities in Korea, with very-well written and fleshed-out lifelike characters and a brilliant allegory of near-complete lack of regard for morals in the world and an underlining that life really is what it is - an unethical and unprincipled survival of the fittest. The most horrible and unsettling thing is, you have a bigger chance of making something of yourself in the abominable and ruthless titular Squid Game than in the equally abominable and ruthless real world.",,,
"Another K-drama, or should I say K-thriller, criticizing inequality in South Korea by having poor people playing deadly childrens games. Sounds crazy, and it is, and very bloody, but also very entertaining. Copy cats are sure to follow.",,,
"Buena serie, muchos huecos y lo único que me molestó fue la tonta muerte de Ali Abdul.",,,
"Squid Game soared high with its thrilling and mysterious storyline. Would've loved to seem them tie up some of the loose ends, and feed the readers more information about the history of the games. Set design and acting was outstanding. Very enjoyable series.",,,
"Could've easily been condensed into a movie. Too much of it slogs on and on, but when it picks up, it really picks up.",,,
it was okay.........,,,
Every twist and turn is easily seen before hand. I'm unsure what all the praise is for nothing new to see here.,,,
The premise of the show and the first half was great. The last few episodes were decent but the pacing wasn't great and the plot with the cop was kind of meh. I was not invested in the story at all and felt it took away from the main plot. Also the acting of the VIPs was so bad that whenever there were scenes with them I just rolled my eyes. Good show but kind of fell flat at the end.,,,
Holy Sh*t! This Is Awesome,,,
Intense. Poor voice acting though lol,,,
"Great show, lots of intrigue. Several characters are easily forgettable and the ending twist can be seen a mile away.",,,
"Very well executed, As it is a Korean series the emotional content was set so right as they always do. The characterization was done well, which shows the relative to the real world behaviors. Thrilling till end.",,,
"Watched this because of all the publicity and hype I've seen recently. Extremely overrated show, I really don't get why people think this is at all good. Guess they've either never watched some decent TV shows, or the pandemic has lowered people's standards greatly",,,
"Squid Game - 10/10. The worldwide phenomenon has taken Netflix by storm, giving the Korean drama a life that many shows wish to have. On the surface a show that is similar to Hunger Games in a sense of people battling it out for their own survival in a competitive nature, deep down inside is a show with shades of other great projects like The Game, Parasite, and The Truman Show. Throw in the concept of an island paradise being misused for a rich person's twisted ideals (a la Enter The Dragon), the show is more than just its gory and intense thrills. It is a showcase of the modern struggle of the working class person, and how money has unfortunately caused people to go into the root of evil that they so desperately want to avoid. The social commentary is outstanding in the show. It's pretty simple to think its overt, but in a show of this nature its necessary. The idea of how people will go to great lengths to solve their problems by literally and mentally kill another person is shocking. The great thing is using children's games as the show's catapult to bringing the people one step closer to solving their adult problems. Quite ironic that something that was played for joy and happiness at one point in life becomes a plea for help and desperation to survive at another juncture in life. There's a beauty to the story telling, and the characters (though cookie cutter in nature at times) fit into the many moulds that exist in society. Hopefully people will understand the true meaning of the show, rather than looking at the violent games for entertainment. All in all, one of the best shows of the year and in recent years!",,,
"Had me glued to my screen for pretty much the whole thing. I saw a couple of the twists coming but didn't see most of the others. Who knew a game of marbles would break me though. Brutal but, scarily, doesn't seem to far out of the realm of possibility",,,
"Riveting. The portrayal of American villains was laughably blunt and stereotypical, but otherwise everything else with treated with surprisingly reality for the situation",,,
[SPOILERS] Loved everything but the end. I wish I could see him hug his daughter in the USA. That cliffhanger at the airport was awful.,,,
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.,,,
Una serie tan polémica como bien lograda. Suspenso constante y conexión absoluta con los protagonistas. Ya es un referente internacional de cómo lograr un excelente guión y mantener la atención del público durante todos sus capítulos. Un most. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😊😊😊,,,
"Muiito bom, depois de arcane, é minha serie favorita.",,,
"A well crafted show. A lot of violent but not torture, which I cannot stand. It speaks about the current social issues through shock and entertainment!",,,
"This show, as most shows do, starts off a bit slow for the sake of establishing the bigger picture. They do so within the first two episodes, but then dig deep into the despair and gore after. The show goes from binge-worthy to cheese wrap-ups by the final two episodes. Granted all the showdowns and build ups between characters are quite interesting, but it still falls somewhat flat by the final episode. They def leave it too open-ended, alluding to a new season follow up some time soon. It's important to note that the acting throughout is phenomenal all around.",,,
It was definitely a binge-worthy show but nothing special. I cannot for the life of me understand how it became the most popular show on Netflix ever. It had an 'ok' plot twist in the end but it wasn't better than Money Heist or the Umbrella Academy.,,,
"Although I initially thought it might be my next favourite TV series, Squid Game fizzled out in dramatic fashion toward the end of its 9 episode run.",,,
"I have read some reviews, and yeah... I watched through my fingers on some scenes. Since squid games I have been searching for Korean Thrillers to see if I can find anything like it! It's a series of games. Somewhat like SAW but aimed at multiple people for every round. The ending, was just a bombshell that I was glad to have waited for. I am now sucking down everything on Roku Streaming because they have some great thrillers there too. I mostly come here to read the reviews but decided to write a few of my own. If you have not seen squid games, what are you waiting for?",,,
Korean series and movies really made my watching experience. This one is not exception,,,
"Korean live action version of Japanese manga. anime and movies. it doesn't bring anything new. except that it has a better character development then Netflix last year movie attempt at this genre sorely lacked. To which there are a lot of similarities to that movie's plot points and ""games"". i did look if it was plagiarism but both according the writer where developed around the same time, after a 1996 japanese manga was made into a anime (""kaiji""). which they both have are alot of similarities too.",,,
"Squid Game delivers a harrowing, poignant introspection of human nature and socioeconomic classes that is grounded by the brutal reality of life in its fictional setting.",,,
This has to go down as one of the most poorly conceived ideas ever. The masses love ot I wonder why has it got to do with the fact that it's so much like peoples lives there all drowning in debt and looking for escape. What complete garbage.,,,
A Must watch in your life! I'm glad I saw this before the hype and went in blind to spoilers.,,,
Just excellent! True in-depth writing and acting!,,,
a fresh dose of air for Netflix,,,
"Great! Smart ideas, intriguing concept. Found myself bingewatching it asking myself what I would have done in certain situations. Got me from beginning to end.",,,
Awesome in every way! A darkly campy commentary on greed and the length people go to fulfill their own needs.,,,
"The story was original, much like some K-dramas nowadays, but with a dark twist. A bit overhyped now, but it's still worth a watch.",,,
"Loved the plot of the film, and also great for a rewatch as so many things you don't notice the first time around. If you're not fluent in Korean, don't watch the dubbed, use the subtitles.",,,
"I'm starting to think Korean media is the better than anything else being produced right now. I loved this show. Fans of The Hunger Games will enjoy this. I recommend watching this in Korean with English subtitles. The English dub is incredibly bothersome and takes away from hearing the beauty of the Korean language. I generally avoid Netflix content, but I was instantly hooked.",,,
"Lived up to the hype. Watched every episode in a single night. When the final episode ended, I wanted more.",,,
"Best Netflix show since Dark, amazing story and the acting is phenomenal. It's funny when it needs to be and extremely emotional in certain moments. Never been this invested in a tv show in awhile, definitely the best show of the year.",,,
Easily the best show of the year,,,
"This show made me a fan of K-Drama. Such a beautiful show. The writing, the stage, the soundtrack everything is great.",,,
"The first 2/3 of this show is fantastic, culminating in a gut-wrenching, heart-breaking episode. And then we get to the ending. Predictable, poorly thought out, and plenty of wtf moments that provide no emotional payoff whatsoever. If you want to check out a dark, bloody, and at times insane Korean show, it's fine for what it is. Don't expect it to pay off in the end though.",,,
Original. Hollywood should take notice what quality is,,,
"I have a hate/love relationship with the show! Sometimes it's exciting, sometimes it's just too depressing.",,,
"Squid game is very interesting, unusual tv series. Before watching I thought it will be similar to tipical kdramas, but it isn't. This TV show is so meaningful. I reccomend it!",,,
Good series but overrated,,,
Nail-biting all the way to the end. (Great enough to even forgive the fact that the show itself is capitalist while being anti-capitalist),,,
Annoying lead characters. 6.5/10,,,
"I don't how this show gained its hype, it's thoroughly boring combined with terrible acting. Not looking forward to this crap.",,,
"I came into this thinking oh not another hunger games/battle royal rip, but this one is pretty great. I watched this with subtitles as i have heard that the English dubbed version has awful voice acting and i enjoyed every minute of it. 10/10 plot, some characters weren't that great but at least most of them died.",,,
I thought it was completely awful. The acting is terrible by the main character. The story was going nowhere when I finally gave up. 30 minutes through and I really couldn't take anymore.,,,
A plain serie with little carachter development,,,
"It was really good, but finale just made it worse a little bit",,,
Must watch this series The ending will explain you a point of the whole 9 episodes. Just binge watched this,,,
squid game is a very good show very entertaining but the thing is its not the plot that made me press for the next episode it was the characters the characters truly kept me engaged in this story in my opinion this shouldn't have season 2 because season 1 was great i highly recommend if you haven't seen it to watch it as soon as you can,,,
Really well done! The acting is phenomenal and it left me wanting to know more. Cant wait for the second season.,,,
Loved from start to finish and still can't stop thinking about it. It isn't just a violent shock show. It is about complex issues that people can face when they become desperate with both money and survival. A brilliantly thought-out and balanced presentation with fascinating surprises along the way. Must see.,,,
Squid Game follows a familiar-ish concept while at the same time being unique. The gore and tension were quite intense for me. The characters were great as you got to know them.,,,
"Binge-worthy series that leaves you wanting more! I finished the series last week and continue to replay the many life lessons from the ""old man"" in my mind. The twist and turns left me speechless. The suspense was intense!",,,
Netflix promised nudity and all we got was an old fat dude's butt. That's about how the show felt.,,,
Can't look away aesthetics mixed with the uniquely deranged plot made for a quick 24 hours here. This got a little weak about 3/4s through with the introduction of some poorly written characters but thankfully wrapped up nicely in my opinion.,,,
"Couldn't fault this series, fantastic premise well executed, brilliant primary and supporting cast, loved the cinematography, and the use of music was just perfect.",,,
"Great story, acting, and a twist at the end. What more can you ask from Netflix! Keep it coming, looking forward to next season :)",,,
"This is a specific series not everyone will love, therefore the mixed reviews. For me personally, it totally hits the mark. The series is strong when it's supposed to be: During the games! The suspense, iconic production design and ost, the acting are altogether being handled perfectly. Especially the guards, the doll and the dalgona cookie game are so memorable that it should be no surprise that they're all over the internet. The costume and production designers did an awesome job. Initally, I didn't like the ending but on second watch it's actually well done and a nice set up for S2. Other than that, the characters are written and acted strongly although fulfilling certain stereotypes, their arcs are satisfying overall. However, I have to subtract one star for the whole subplot with the policeman, which literally leads to nothing and has no conclusion at all.",,,
"Verdict: Watch it! This is one of the best new shows of 2021, probably because it's Korean and doesn't overly force politics onto the audience (shocking!). While it's not perfect, it's definitely worth a watch. What starts out as a critique of capitalism quickly turns into a rebuke of socialism with no definitive resolution, other than to be kind. The first episode dwells way too long how bad Seong Gi-hun's life is. He's a degenerate gambler, terrible father, and needs to get out of debt quickly. So he's lured to the Squid Games - which take in people in large debt to play kids games for a chance to win billions of dollars. Unless you've been living under a rock, this quickly devolves into a bloodbath as contestants are violently executed for not winning. The cast is amazing & I'll avoid spoilers as there is one in particular that will ruin everything. I will say that while the show is captivating, the ending is infuriating. Yes, they do explain almost everything - everything that is major is revealed - yet Seong continues to make one bad decision after another. Some choices and outcomes are perplexing - it's a case of ""no real person would make that choice"" plot syndrome. In these regards the writers could have done better. On the whole, this is an excellent show & definitely worth the binge.",,,
It was good enough to keep me watch until the end. So I believe it was a good show,,,
"La serie es muy SOBREVALORADA, pero es buena y disfrutable, no es para gente corazon debil, es muy cruda solo que la cantidad de sangre es muy EXAGERADA, la serie es buena pero no es para tanto.",,,
This is a very suspenful and gripping story. And the best part is they managed to get me to watch it subbed rather than dubbed.,,,
"Interesting concept, but outstayed it's welcome.",,,
EPIC watch not for the faint hearted,,,
"Why are people so crazy about this stupid show? Granted my wife and I only watched the first two episodes but WTF? We found absolutely nothing appealing. Everything was mediocre: the writing (something lost in translation?), the acting, the directing.... The two episodes we saw were two too many. ugh",,,
"Overrated, TBH. Overrated and predictable. Look behind the varnish and you can see that the show doesn't have anything meaningful to say, even in a world with incredible income inequality.",,,
An almost perfect show. Shows that big tv studio execs couldn't find a hit if it bit them on the rear! Thank God for Netflix. High replay value.,,,
bad show why everyone love it ? this show is just copying every survival movie,,,
"Interesting idea, pretty visuals, but bad writing. Just to take one example toward the end and trying to be spoiler free. There's a scene where people need to finish a task within a time limit or die. The person in front is blocking people behind. When time is about to run out the person behind pushes the person in front to their death removing the block and saving themselves and the people behind them. After saving their lives, the person who was at the furthest end of the line, who would have died if they'd hesitated even 1/2 a second longer, balls out the person who effectively saved their life for killing someone. That right there is bad writing. Worse writing is that the person who saved everyone's lives didn't come back and point out they'd all be dead if it wasn't for their actions. The show is full of bad writing like this where what the characters say and or do doesn't make much sense because of bad writing. That said, it was still interesting to watch.",,,
If you watch this and only leave thrilled you have missed the point. This is a story of depth. A tale we all go through I believe. What we think when we are at our bottom and feel a failure when people expect us to exceed and save them from the misery of both our and their lives. Satire at it's best.,,,
Saw it once. Glad I did. Won't watch it again.,,,
"Good TV show, but nothing more",,,
"Great show. Other than one arc that, made little sense to me, & a couple of repetitive points, I enjoyed the emotional & intense rollercoaster ride. I am glad America is getting to see some good stuff from abroad.",,,
Amazing show! Soooo intense!,,,
"A cultural phenomenon and such a unique experience - I'm gonna miss this show and the feeling I got watching it for the first time. I'm still reeling from that ending (the last two episodes really)... This show just ripped my heart out, made me obsessed with its main concept and characters... and yeah, I'm just stunned and kind of devastated by how it ended. This one's gonna stick with me for a long time... definitely one of the most memorable, impactful shows I've watched in a long time.",,,
"Creative and original, Squid Game works on so many levels. It bristles with intriguing social commentary, nail-biting action and packs some surprising and satisfying twists and turns. Fresh, inventive, and moving. It takes its audience on a brutal, stylish and unforgettable ride.",,,
It's as good as they say… absolutely brilliant.,,,
"I love this series, except episode 7. They should keep it all Korean. Can't wait for next season!",,,
"Squid Game takes the best elements of tension, character development, and storytelling all into this one show. It's directed incredibly well and equally written very well. The show does a good job of showcasing why many would join this crazy game and how life can be so dreadful. You care about the characters and what they bring to the story. This season was almost perfection.",,,
This show was terrible. Don't waste your time.,,,
Squid Game was a shocking surprise providing audiences with characters many can relate to and cheer on. The series also includes some out-of-the-world games and suspense throughout where audiences expect the unexpected.,,,
"A nice Korean series with some interesting games and the major plus point is that is the sets that they made for games and dormentary. I didn't like the 6th episode of the season cause It was kinda draggy at some of the portions . I think it would have been better if they give a proper ending .I think there will be a season 2 thats why they ended it like that. Overall, my review of squid game is a popcorn worthy series u may give a try this weeked",,,
Squid Game Season 1 (A) My perspective on this show drastically changed after the first episode. I thought it was to over the top and cheesy acting but that wasn't the case at all. After episode one I switched the show from the awful English dub that was making the show feel cheesy and weird and put it on the Korean language with English subtitles. All of a sudden the suspense actually felt suspenseful. The show gets very dark and honestly makes you feel really sad but it does an amazing job of this. The imagery in this show is something that will most likely never leave my mind. I would also be lying if I said I didn't binge this show. Some of the gross things that happen can be a little over the top but the storyline is. So thrilling and the revaltions left me speechless. Please if you watch squid game watch it in Korean with subtitles. It changes the mood of the show to what it was aiming for. All in all this show changed culture and became a massive international success. Everyone will remember this show whether they like it or not. I definitely like it but warn you that people who aren't used to mature themes and graphic violence should stay away until they can stomache those types of things.,,,
"Very entertaining and high in production quality, but it suffered from some predictable writing and over the top acting issues. It was obvious from the get go who was going to win and last the longest because those were characters that received the most development. However, some of the plot twists worked, including the one at the end. Most episodes were well paced and a pleasure to watch thanks to lots of brutal action and decent dialogue, but the episode when everybody left could have been better. I'll also say that the red hair ending and not getting on the plane was a bit weird, and it was disappointing not hearing anything more about the police officer considering how OP he was earlier on. Several characters were overdone acting and dialogue wise, like the woman who struggled to find a team and the main character in places. However, there was a good mix of characters, the acting was generally impressive, and the extras did a good job. Then the cinematography, sets/props/costumes, visual effects, editing, and soundtrack were all excellent for a TV show.",,,
"Quickly became my favorite show of all time. Honestly, I found it extraordinary. One of the very few times I've found a show worthy of all the hype. From the cinematography to the concept and everything in between. BUT PLEASE WATCH IT WITH SUBTITLES! It makes a huge difference. I watched it dubbed the second time amd it takes so much away.",,,
".... This show had me. I was gripped the entire time. And then they lost me in the last episode. I didn't understand it, I didn't like it, and it tainted the whole show for me.",,,
"Predictable but with a good story, is all that can be said about this series.",,,
I really didn't get the hype for this one. Inconsistent flow and some big topics that barely got any attention where small topics were stretched out.,,,
Boring and predictable,,,
"I really enjoyed the show, and I loved watching each game. I found that it could have been a little shorter though, maybe 6 or 7 episodes as opposed to 9. The side plot with the police officer was unnecessary and lead to a reveal I don't believe was necessary either.",,,
"Had a lot of fun watching this. Almost didn't make it past the first episode though. The English dubbing is awkward at best and there are long scenes that are way to slow. Some of the episodes were overly predictable too. If you can overlook a few shortcomings, the series is very entertaining.",,,
Amazing show. Episodes 1 and 2 are average but the rest are amazing. You relate to your character and become attached and engaged with them. Would watch again.,,,
"let s start saying that eastern culture is completely different from the western..said that i don t understand how this show is popular in europe, us... this is just the proof that people follow what is popular. many asian might find this serie amazing but from a western guy point of view i have to say: - acting was terrible, a lot of overreaction for nothing. read that dubbing was bad. not at all, that s how asians talk and behave. if you didn t like the dubbing is because you don t like the style, as different from your culture. - everything in the movie was very predictable (at least untill episode 7, then i stopped watching). - extremely forced and pointless emotional scene, build up on hypocrisy and very obvious cliches. the idea itself was nothing new but good, the rest rubbish. i could like it if i was asian or maybe 11 years old (without splatter scene)",,,
"""Squid's Game"" evoks a heartfelt story about humanity in the case of a brutal ultra violent series of games that seeks to take the humanity out of it's characters, an enjoyable watch from beginning to end.",,,
Wonderful and very unique story which had us binge it in two sittings,,,
"An incredible series. Such a level of tension and interest has not been caused for a long time by TV series and, in principle, everything that has been in pop culture for a long time. Applause for the creators!",,,
"Derived from countless other iterations. From The Most Dangerous Game, to Logan's Run, to Running Man, to Hunger Games, Battle Royale -- and on and on. There is effectively nothing new here, only the window-dressing has changed. I would rate it somewhat higher if the English dub wasn't so atrocious.",,,
Very gory and disturbing at times but such is life. I felt for many of the characters and understood how most of the people's intentions and reasons for doing the things they did. Great season considering that this was the first time some of the actors were actors.,,,
"You might predict that this'll borrow heavily from Battle Royale or the Hunger Games franchise, but that'd undervalue how much fresh content Squid Game manages to bring. Hugely compelling and with worthwhile character arcs. You might find some of the decision-making of the characters a little baffling, but you'll find yourself genuinely shocked, saddened and triumphant throughout this series. Such good TV.",,,
"Absolutely nothing new on the table, absolutely overhype by the N giant, the story is absolutely obvious and a blatant rip off of soooo many Japanese shows. Yes I know it's Korean but there are tons of Japanese stories with pretty much the same basic setting. The trailer was much better than the real thing.",,,
"Meh. I watched it while it was gaining popularity, but not yet this huge thing, and I thought it was just decent and didn't plan on finishing it. If ur just gonna watch it bc everyone else is talking about it, you'll probably be disappointed, bc it is definitely overrated, or at least talked about more than it would deserve as a really good show. I think this shows popularity comes more from good costume and set designs than it being good. Really not worth the watch unless ur watching it for the culture.",,,
"Highly Overrated, very silly",,,
It was a really good show. It was interesting how they put kid games into the whole thing.,,,
Wow; brutal but couldn't turn it off.,,,
absolute loved this series! hope theres a season 2!,,,
Very enjoyable change from the common western tropes that dominate the current TV shows these days.,,,
"Amazing storyline, reminds me a lot of Battle Royale, Darwin's Game, and other horror battle anime…",,,
"Finally finished. The writing was fairly obvious and very heavy handed, but overall it was entertaining.",,,
"It's worth watching. The good parts are creative and captivating. The rest is essentially a woman telling a guard she has to pee, but it lasts for 3 minutes.",,,
I don't know how anyone could not like this show? I'm looking forward to Netflix's future foreign offerings!,,,
I don't honestly understand the plot line or attraction to this show.,,,
It's good. It's not as big as the hype.,,,
"It's not an original plot, but it's well written. Amazing characters, the show made you worry about them.",,,
"Ok, it's rather fun but also grossly overrated. Something is lacking here: 1/ we're used to ""torture porn for the entertainment of rich people"". So no surprise here. 2/ the motivation of the ""puppet master"" is ridiculous and doesn't make sense from a psychological point of view... So eventually, if the show is entertaining, and an easy critics of our capitalist system, it doesn't really quench the thirst it gives you in the first place.",,,
"Squid Game is a South Korean survival drama. I started watching the series after seeing the trailer thinking of it as a cool fun adventure thriller, instead, it turned out to be more of a hard-hitting human story. It has so much depth for a survival series genre which is mainly known for brutality and gore, which it has in plenty, but also adds to it with the writing having heart-wrangling social commentary. The writing and direction are class, the casting spot on, the music, set pieces as well as camera angle really add to the thrill. The only complaint I have is, it was two episodes too long, dragged in the middle.",,,
This is one of the best things I have seen in a while it has a simple but interesting story line and has some emotional parts in this is a must see,,,
Brilliant series. I loved it. At first it was hard to understand the brutality of killings but by the 2nd episode I was hooked. The lessons learned and the philosophy of life taught from each episode was priceless. I can't wait for the second season. This was one of the best unexpected shows that Netflix launched.,,,
"Absolutely incredible. I watched the dubbed version, and decided to rewatch the entire series in its original language with English subs. If you're not into gore, blood, or violence, it's definitely NOT for you.",,,
"I didn't like the series. It doesn't make any sense. I would rather see a series with 20 or 30 seasons about the life of José Castelo Branco. Too ridiculous series, I don't understand how people like this dump!",,,
I'm sorry but super overrated.,,,

"Plotholes so thick you might actuall bury the 200000 people they killed over 30 years.. in the same region. Even thinking slightly about the story of the movie hurts... 400-500 people per game, at least 12 seasons per year starting in 1988. And what about all the survivors who left due to democratic vote? They have thousands of people with the same story. His report to the local police should be more than a well known story.. and seriousl 200000 people gone even in a span pf 30 years.. thats murder on such a scale... it would impact the GDP of the country... whoever wrote this clearly has their plot development as high a level as the actual kid games.. yet stikl the acting was very great BUT the voice acting is beyond atrocious no matter if its due to bad directing or bad voice actors. For all the hype watching this was a very sober disappointment.",,,
It's good but too much character development that wasn't needed. Should have been ½ hour episodes instead of the hour long ones that most of them were,,,
This is an amazing Korean drama! This drama really show the true colors when one is desperate for money.,,,
legit emotional rollercoaster. laughed and cried. a must see!,,,
It's fine. Worth your time.,,,
"The plot just jumps around to fill holes creating new holes. That became very apparent in the end. It's hyped because the whole battle royale and hunger games stuff is on trend… but it's not a good storyline, acting is meh… dubs are worse.",,,
Excellent. A must see. Visually stunning.,,,
"I wish one day cinema will stop exploiting the BattleRoyal genre and come up with something new. Anyway - pretty much cliche series, with a cardboard cutouts level of actor's performance, where plot and main characters are easily guessed from the first episode. 3 stars only because how perfectly it portrays the modern capitalistic society where anything can be done for $$ and $$ justifies all. Even torturing and murdering of your fellow humans.",,,
"Honestly didn't think I would like this as much as I did. Also didn't expect to get sucked into watching this all in one sitting. The character development that this had is something that is missing from most cinema, especially on Netflix. Can add this to the handful of good Netflix originals, unlike all of their live action anime adaptations.",,,
"The series has some amazing scenery but at times the acting/dialogue is subpar and borderline unbearable. However, at other times the acting in certain scenes was outstanding. Looking forward to season 2.",,,
"""Squid Game"" isn't a perfect show by any means, but it's hard to not smile as it's ludicrous story progresses. This show certainly possesses some qualities that I've come to expect from the South Korean film industry.",,,
"a violent romp, not much more",,,
Awesome! bingwatched,,,
"It's good, but not THAT good to justify all the hype.",,,
"What a ride. The character interactions, acting, dialogue, etc. can feel very forced, unnatural, and borderline bizarre, but this is all unusually in service to Squid Game's charm as a completely unbelievable show in the first place. There is an undeniable thrill to the games themselves and these handily carry the entire experience. The cop subplot is great in its middle sections, but ultimately leads to an unsatisfying ""conclusion."" The show wasn't immediately great, but it's fantastic mid section helps carry enough weight for both its mediocre start and finish.",,,
I was so bored! No idea what the hype is all about. Certainly not a new idea.,,,
"Its unique, but really bad.",,,
"Absolutely nothing to like about this show. The episodes drag along tediously, the acting is abysmal, and the concept is straight awful, not in any way interesting or philosophical. The only disturbing thing it says about society is how so many people think this is good TV.",,,
"I found this pretty ""slow"", full of forced interactions and unnecessarily emotive with a lot of overacting.",,,
"Squid Game — stylish, shocking, edge-of-your-seat exciting — the show somehow manages to comment on major themes in life while brutally pushing the edge of what constitutes fun and games. Put a bunch of recent college graduates in that immense ""dorm"" room with green tracksuits and show clips of how much they or their parents owe to lenders and you might be surprised who stays to play. What the show gets right is the crushing, soul-depleting, and dehumanizing desperation of people who are in debt. The college financial aid office, much like the game makers, could always argue — well, you had a choice and you decided to bet your life on this path. That still doesn't rest easy on our collective conscience. (NOTE: There are spoilers ahead so please don't read until you've watched all 9 episodes) That ""choice"" is a brilliant wrench in this story — does it absolve Oh Il-nam from guilt for all the deaths? Is that how the workers rationalize their participation in this horrible form of entertainment? ""Once you tap the squid's head, you win and yell out, ""Victory."" At that moment, I felt as if I owned the entire world, exhilarated."" Did you assume it was Gi-hun saying this in the opening voiceover while the boys were playing in the schoolyard? To the contrary, what this narrator says matches up with what Oh Il-nam says in the end, ""When I was young, I had so much fun, no matter what I did with my friends that I lost track of time. I wanted to feel the same feeling one more time before I die…"" [Side note: for the director to give away the ending like this right off the bat is pretty badass!] A lot of what he says resonates with viewers today — in how many of us are now living fractured lives, monitoring others and invading their privacy through social media (in the same way the guards are viewing the contestants on TV screens), consuming large quantities of ""entertainment"" that is increasingly gory and sexualized. This separation from community is something precious that was lost with the invention of the smartphone and all we have left are distant memories. Fellow Gen Xers: do you still have memories of playing kickball, SPUD, and other childhood games? Sadly, will our children have that joy to look back on when they are old? Only when you are young does time stretch out and the threat of mortality barely register in one's mind. Is this not the ever-elusive state we all aspire to? Because in that moment when you are lost in a state of deep play it feels like you are, in fact, your true self. I find it hard to fault the old man for recognizing this about himself and seeking out that connection with Gi-hun. He thanks Gi-hun for being a gganbu for him — someone more concerned about an old man's welfare than absolving his own debts. In a way, the game brought out far more human qualities in Gi-hun that he had in the beginning of the show. It's a testament to Lee Jung-Jae's acting that no matter how despicable his character's actions were, we rooted for him. The show only works if we want that second chance for him, too. So, in the same way Gatsby threw a party to meet Daisy, did Oh Il-nam create the game to connect with people like Gi-hun on a personal level? Finding that gganbu in life is actually more important than money? It's also curious as to why he says it was he that allowed Gi-hun to live. Is that just referring to the marble game when he faked amnesia and gave him his last marble? Or, was Gi-hun somehow the predetermined winner? Does Oh Il-nam always side with the person he personally likes and roots for and helps to make sure he does so? This would support the theory that I've read about Oh Il-Nam being Gi-hun's father. It's certainly a plausible theory, though supposedly denied by the director. Why else is the old man so concerned as to why Gi-hun isn't using the prize money at the end and tries to help him feel less guilty about winning? continue reading.... https://medium.com/@mparkster/all-the-worlds-a-squid-game-stage-f5e67bb2a78b",,,
"Honestly, I didn't know what to expect from this show. Things got fricken deep though! I almost cried watching Ali die. He was my favorite character immediately! This show has interesting story telling to keep viewers engaged, characters to love and characters to hate, tear jerking moments, character development, and deep themes. Not for the faint of heart, but still a great show!",,,
this may be the biggest thing since GOT... i loved the childhood games... just brings us back to memory lane...,,,
"It's good but kinda overhyped, that's the trouble with these shows that explode in popularity. The English dub/subtitles are kinda comically bad, mostly because the Korean script was lazily translated using Google. Looking forward to Season 2, hopefully they do better with the dub/subtitles next time.",,,
"Squid game is a macabre, dystopian commentary on the modern societal hierarchy, beautifully represented through it's stunning cast, creativity, and it's quietly haunting energy. Another amazing product born from the ingenuity of Korean media.",,,
"Since the show was hyped so much I thought I'd give it a try and to be honest felt disappointed after watching it. The biggest problem was that it was to predictable with the exception of the final episode, which had a nice plot twist, but the rest wasn't surprising at all. I actually could predict almost all key moments. The pacing felt kind of slow and some storylines were not that interesting nor did they further the story. Another issue was that I could not relate or connect to the characters, I did not feel much about any of the characters. Premise of the show is fun, but I must have missed something, because I did not enjoy is at much as most people did…. In all honesty, even 1987's Running Man with Schwarzenegger was better, but hey that's just me.",,,
"What I liked. The story was captivating, with the desire to find out what is going to happen next. The actor provided many captivating moments here and there. What I disliked. Pretty much everything else starting with production or lack thereof. The show felt as if it was following a rough first draft that was never fleshed out. The final episode was a waste of time.",,,
"Loved this series, not only did it do the classic death game, in a perfect way, it had so many other things and qualities that was near perfection as well. By far one of the best series I have ever seen.",,,
"After watching them, the first feeling was... bitterness. During the game of Mugunghwa Kkotchi pioetseumnuda, when Young Hee shoot people, it was shocking. Young Hee is the most adorable character in Korea with Chulsoo, her classmate. Lovely Young Hee transformed into a monster there.... Nostalgie from my childhood games, but current adult life is full of bitterness. I could not stop watching when I started, then I lost a word when I finished. But still, I recommend watching the series because the story is the reality that we, all face.",,,
"Even though it is a good production, actors are great, real life situations are interesting. The series humiliates people publicly, constantly. I didn't enjoy seeing people being humiliated on camera. This series establishes class division as if it was true. Deterministic. And according to this, it's okay that losers go through such trials because they deserve it. They deserve to be punished for being idiots or losers or being lower class. The author converted people into fighting dogs. We are watching them, as inferior beings. THAT IS NOT OKAY. Public shaming is wrong. Debasement of human dignitiy is wrong. Everyone deserves a second chance. And be treated with respect. Types like these form wrong impressions on society. Same with violence. We get used to seeing explicit violence. As if this IS the world. That is not right.",,,
"Loved the series, hates the ending.",,,
"Squid Game is such a successful show that presented one-of-a-kind filmmaking elements that were never seen before. From its unique story to its visually stunning shots, the show deserved everything it got. The show really presented a powerful dramatic topic in the most beautiful way. You constantly be asking yourself who is right and who is wrong?. You get to see the different emotional decisions that characters have to go through to either sacrifice their lives or defend and protect themselves. Really loved how the show manifests the different characters and the diversity between them. It doesn't focus on one character, it rather focuses on around 7 different characters. You get to see the old, the young, the poor, the rich, the female, the male, and even the husband and wife. This makes the story even 10x better as we get to see everything and everyone's decision and how they react to these different games. I feel like the show was better when it was mysterious. As soon as things started to get revealed to us, the show lost itself and that mysteriousness vibe that it was offering. But, at the same time if things kept being mysterious, then the questions would've never been answered so the show would've been even worse. The show had plot holes and things that just didn't make sense at all. Like stupid decisions made by characters, or stupid character developments, or cheezy lines like the ones in ""English"" (and not Korean). Like why not keep everything in Korean?! Why do you have to add English dialogues and characters?!. But on the other hand, the show offered us many elements that covered these bad plot holes and made us not think about them as much as we think about the good stuff. For instance, the visually stunning set design with its beautiful colors that are matching perfectly together and with each game that they were playing especially they are meant to be for children so the bright pinky colors explain all of that. The custom designs as well alongside the masks gave that scary, suspense, and thriller atmosphere. The acting is beyond amazing. Each actor presented the dramatic side and life of their character perfectly and their acting plays a huge part in how we were easily connecting with each character. The acting of the VIPs was one of the worst things that I have ever seen. The show's 9 episodes are written very beautifully and carefully. This is why they turned to be great. The 2nd episode with its amazing title, ""Hell"" explains every back story. Although it was a boring episode, without it the show would've literally been nothing and the characters would've meant nothing. Really loved how the show presented a specific character that was quiet and didn't have any lines in the whole show except for one specific episode and we were easily connected emotionally to that character. It took the writer only one episode to make us connect deeply with the character that was quiet in previous episodes. That is enough to explain how each thing about this whole TV show was written with deep thinking and creativity. Finally, the beautiful music score is composed by Jung Jaeil, the same composer of Parasite (2019). You can hear the similarities between the two. Especially that both of them discuss such a sensitive and realistic topic which is greed, the difference between the poor and rich, and what people are willing to do for ""money"". The music score played an important role, especially in emotional scenes. They made these scenes way more emotional than they should be and added a lot of meaning to them. My rating is 8.5/10.",,,
"So many interesting characters. Hats off to the writers of this enthralling, scary, compelling bloody thriller!",,,
Hunger games with poverty porn,,,
"Amazing start, very suspenseful, believable and likable (and dislikable!) characters. The only critique I'd have is how the show spoonfeeds you all the answers rather than leaving it to the interpretation of the audience to answer the questions for themselves. Aside from that, I really recommend it! Some really great emotional scenes and action scenes.",,,
"Decent series but nothing special. If your not into eastern movies, or anime it could be mind blowing and I think that is essentially what is happening with its hype right now. Anyway about it, you'll like the series and want to get to the end.",,,

"prefer to watch Disney movies, but I am a fan of Korean movies and I forced myself to grit my teeth and watch this. It was a masterpiece of showing human emotions, and what they are capable of doing, under the severest conditions to survive, the growing desensitation of death, and I have not stopped thinking about the horrors and what humans are capable of doing, and the meanings and lessons this teaches, in a horrible way, of life.",,,
"Excellent direction, screenplay.",,,
"As someone who really enjoys Death Game settings and the portrayal of psychological impact and primal instincts that come out in such scenarios, i really gotta say the series did an amazing job bringing out the Characters growth during these games. https://shrinke.me/AgL5xK8",,,
"🇰🇷 Wildly entertaining!!! This South Korean survival drama is the biggest hit of the year on Netflix, and rightly so. The 9-episode series revolves around a contest in which 456 cash-strapped players with huge debts accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games with deadly high stakes for the chance to win a ₩45.6 billion prize. Written and directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, it is a project that took 10 years in the making and ended up becoming one of the greatest series ever. Extremely satisfying (even if the main character Gi-hun has an unbelievable luck), quite compelling from beginning to end and fun to watch. The music is thrilling, the production design is out of this world and the insane plot has a great development for each of its characters. Also, what a plot twist at the end! Overall, it is an intelligent social commentary on how predatory capitalism can be and it is savage!",,,
"Quite decent. This kept me engaged and entertained throughout. Very imaginative. It was like ""Hunger Games,"" but with more taste.",,,
"Despite not being particularly unprecedented, it is an appealing exploration of how incentives shape our behavior. Also, it sets the bar high for the battle royale genre in terms of production quality. Some scenes are particularly enjoyable due to their subtle and concise storytelling.",,,
This was an excellent series. Really well done. A series that will stick with you for weeks after watching.,,,
"I started watching the show not knowing much about it and really enjoyed it. Great acting, great characters, great story / plot with some twists and surprises. Some of the episodes will get you feeling a bit teary eyed and annoyed as you feel so invested in it. Thoroughly recommend",,,
"Una serie que se distingue del resto, genial!!",,,
Very good show very similar to Kaiji anime I expected and liked the ending,,,
Overall very good. Nothing quite like it on tv. Absolutely fascinating concept and execution.,,,
"Perhaps it could be said that the show was overhyped for me. The main character is completely pathetic and yet acts morally superior to everyone and everything happening around him. There is little clever strategy or interesting interplay during the games. the pacing of the show plods along so slowly i had my finger itchy on the skip 10seconds button. there are many elements that are half-baked like potential cheaters and identities of the staff, interplay between games, etc that are setup but then forgotten. some of the games themselves don't make sense, there is one in particular where there is a high probability that everyone will die and players don't have any meaningful strategies to employ. the ""vip""s of the show are acted extremely poorly and completely cringe. sure, there's a lot of brutality and bloodshed. but in terms of the way people might behave in extreme situations, that's a story that's been told a million times in a million places. this series' unique draw of twisted children games isn't particularly implemented in a way that i found compelling. given the series' success and set up for a sequel, we'll see where the story goes from here.",,,
"The first two or three episodes were ok. Somewhat limited by atrocious acting and poor dubbing, but I could forgive that in deference to the great sets (I loved the Red Light, Green Light scene, but this was an early peak) and the (apparently) intriguing storyline. Unfortunately, it collapses into a plot that lurches from one ridiculous scenario to another with no cohesion, characters who offer little (or no) consistency making it hard to empathise with any of them (even the ""hero""), and a farcical (even by the rest of the series' standards) final episode. It even attempts to promote some sort of moral message which is as inconsistent as the rest of the storyline. Started well and plummeted quickly IMHO.",,,
Binged the season in one night with coworkers. Action and gorefest if that's what you're looking for (and we were).,,,
"I've been getting into K-dramas lately and it's nice to have one I can see with my husband. I don't think it's too violent compared to other psychological thrillers or Quentin Tarantino. They did a fantastic job on the look of the film. The use of their bright colors, filters, and lighting are beautiful. Reminds me of Wes Anderson with a twist. The story and human condition analysis is spot on and relatable to the every day struggles. The actors are fantastic! Definitely watch it subtitled, not dubbed! The dubbed version looks like the actors read a script without ever seeing the movie.",,,
could have been so much better. the end kinda ruined it,,,
I liked it. It went in a completely different direction than I thought. I did not care for the last episode. It was sort of like meh why but it did leave it open for a second season. Which I have reservations against since the way it ended.,,,
"Very interesting concept and storyline are somewhat overshadowed by the dialogue and over the top acting. Sometimes felt like watching a 1950s Japanese Godzilla film as far as acting, particularly the main character.",,,
"I loved the lead performances (I watched part of it with subtitles and part of it dubbed) and the unusual ""game"" setting. I appreciated viewing the game sequences as metaphors for work, play, loyalty and betrayal in real life. However, as so many continuous-plot series do, it outwore its welcome. There was a change in tone from dark comedy to sentimentality in the final ""game"" episode, and resorted to a shock character twist at the end that undermined the entire story. I recommend the series but it's a mixed bag.",,,
Excellente série.......Scotché vu en 2 jours......,,,
"Squid Game is one of those ""hidden gems"" that luckily were discovered by the masses. Squid game is a breath of fresh air when it comes to TV, for at least Western audiences. No preaching of specific messages, no holding back, just plain gritty and real characters. The fact that one person wrote the entire season on his own shows the dedication. The characters are believable, you feel their anger, frustration, and fear. No character is the same, and every character has a purpose. Hopefully, this show will inspire Western filmmakers to rethink their approach to movies. I will absolutely walk away from handsome men with suitcases offering me money on the subway from now on.",,,
Breaking Bad WAS my fave TV series. Squid Game takes over. Gganbu for life - that episode affected me! I don't want a second season . . . hard to imagine where it will go next.,,,
"What a great series! The actors look like ""regular"" people, with flaws and everything. I see some people online talking about capitalism. I don't think that's the main point. I believe it's just about how people's weaknesses and strengths come out under stress. Money was just a tool to put them in the stress filled situation. It's kind of like the first season of walking dead, where it was more about how people reacted emotionally to the zombie threat. I've seen some comments on how the women were portrayed. I think it was realistic. Your average everyday person who is physically smaller would probably need to rely on intelligence and strategy to get through a survival situation like the game. Doesn't mean they're not as good, just that they have different strengths. The smaller and weaker men also needed to be cunning to survive, but somehow most Lowell overlook that fact. All in all, it's defiant worth a watch. I would even go so far as to say if you've been thinking about getting Netflix for a notch to binge some shows, this is the time to do it, just for this show!",,,
Too comercial and pop,,,
"Great show. The ending isn't perfect, but overall it's a good concept with lots of memorable characters and moments.",,,
"This show was a surprise hit for me. Instantly in the first episode, you are hooked by the intriguing characters and the mystery that is only spurred on by the fantastic design choices. Not proper for children, this show does not shy away from violence while also not abusing such and employing it where it best makes sense. The characters are compelling and the story gets more intense each episode. A must watch.",,,
"One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is ""Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake"". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog? Firstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series. I also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these. Another reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother's card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don't feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game. Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.",,,
really good series! (still dont get why they let that woman in episode 7 stayed alive tho... or why didnt the rest kill her in the bedrooms when its clearly allowed and she made fun of em),,,
"Round 6 starts well, with amazing worldbuilding and good potential characters, with one exception. The first three games are genuinely tense, despite having predictable results, and on the second one, there was a death I confess I laughed (it remembered me of Quentin Tarantino's style). From the sixth episode onwards, the show loses pace incredibly. The sixth episode is by far the worst of all, it's super boring, and I started it happy because I thought something happened, but in the end, it didn't, and what really happened doesn't make sense according to the rules of that universe. The seventh and eighth episodes are better, and the heist subplot is the best part of the show. But the ninth and last one is disappointing. The final game is anticlimatic and there's a plot twist that definitely doesn't make sense and wouldn't be missed if it was removed. I think the biggest mistake of Round 6 was to focus on one specific character and present the world from his point of view. It turns the show predictable and removes the tension almost completely (especially at the 5th and the 6th games). I know it would be a more distant show if we were presented to this universe as a spectator, but it would be better to put us in this world as Player 457, not inside Player 456 (the protagonist).",,,
"Cringingly violent, visually incredible, socially and politically prescient, at times humorous, and endlessly entertaining. It's not 100% original, the voice overs aren't perfect (which adds to the appeal), and the acting is at times melodramatic, but this show is absolutely binge-worthy. Ignore the detractors, Squid Game is light years better than the vast majority of the televised garbage people entertain themselves with. Watch it.",,,
"DAMN!! THAT WAS GOOD!! yes there was some issues, but no politics, AND an original idea/story? YES PLEASE!!",,,
This is overrated. I found it really depressing and overly bleak. The ending was confusing and a bit unfocused and the setup for next season plain unrealistic. I won't be back for season for this depression-fest. The premise of the show is interesting and unique.,,,
Visually stunning and scathing indictment of modern hyper-capitalism.,,,
"Before watchng it I questioned why anyone would. After the first episode, I kinda got the fascination. As the show progressed I got the writer's intent regarding how desperate people can get in life and what they would be willing to do. The characters each had their attraction and foibles. Although some of the action was predictable, the progressively deeper revelations about the characters was interesting. In contrast to many reviews here. I found the last episode satisfying and a revealing look at the super rich.",,,
The idea for the show would have so much potential. But it is all ruined with the portrayed style of acting and slapstick. Hard to watch.,,,
"It's interesting in the beginning, after the 4th, 5th episode it gets kinda predictable, but still, it's worth it. Hopefully, we'll see an interesting 2nd season.",,,
"This is literally one of the best shows I have ever watched. The plot is amazing, the characters are amazing, the sets are amazing, basically this show is amazing. It's very gory and violent, but also really develops the characters so that you're connected to all of them. Definitely watch this.",,,
"A breath of fresh (but humanity decaying, desperate and life choking) air is this show! (Yep I've said it before about another show, applies here too.) Well thought out scenario, impressive scenes, amazing acting. Nevermind the hype, it is still a rare gem among shows..",,,
"What do you get if you cross Hunger Games with Takeshi's Castle? Squid Game. I wouldn't call it horror as it isn't remotely scary. Psychological Thriller, definitely. It extremely graphic and it doesn't take too long to start genuinely caring if some of the players survive the next game. Or hoping they don't. I don't want to say too much to avoid spoilers but if you don't mind a bit of gore then you owe to yourself to watch this. The story is amazing and despite what some say, has a satisfying conclusion, even if we don't ever get a second season. Oh and whatever you do, watch it with Korean audio and English subtitles. The voice acting in the dubbed audio takes so much away for the atmosphere that the original actors bring to the show.",,,
I must see for any fan of South Korean films/TV shows. The best way to watch it is in its original language with the subtitles. Once you finish the series you should go on YouTube and watch all the Easter eggs that are in the TV show and also look at the behind the scenes at how they film some of the parts. One of the best things about this show is that the director doesn't like to use to use CGI So everything was custom built,,,
"Non è onesto raggiungere il successo solo perché i media scrivono che ha fatto record e tutti vogliono vederlo. L'ho trovato ripetitivo, per niente originale, davvero banale e spesso noioso",,,
Disturbingly amazing!,,,
This show is wildly entertaining with a unflinching criticism of capitalism.,,,
excelente!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,
"This show has become a cultural phenomenon, so just watch it. It's good. Not transcendentally great, but good. Reminds me of a Korean cross between Hunger Games and Eyes Wide Shut.",,,
"Cool premise, but the execution was lacklustre.",,,
"AMEI, simplesmente amei tudo o que foi apresentado.",,,
"Excellent show, providing you don't mind the voice over",,,
Excellent! Finally a show that reminds us what entertainment means. Lots of interesting sub stories. Violence. Visually interesting. Acting very good. Nice to see social justice issues disappeared into the background where they belong.,,,

Believe the hype. Best TV show of 2021,,,
"This series is awesome, it's funny, thrilling and splatter to the right point.",,,
Lame at the end of it all.,,,
simply amazing. loved it,,,
Much better than the Mike Flanagan shows.,,,
"The Korean action-drama has become the international hit television event of 2021, and it's easy to see why, as it's an incredibly smart genre show that thankfully has as much humanity as it does brutality. Drawing comparisons to other titles that featured contestants participating in a lethal game (i.e. Hunger Games, Battle Royale), Squid Game uses its set-up to display social commentary and complex moral dilemma, and it usually fires from all cylinders. Conceived and scripted back in 2008 by Hwang Dong-hyuk, Squid Game's subtext regarding class dispositions and marginalized people still feels highly relevant, and the filmmaking is always visceral and engaging, even when the show becomes difficult to watch. The violence in Squid Game is indeed plentiful, and often graphic, but the plights of the characters are genuinely heartfelt, and the concluding episode really earns it somber tone, augmented by the bloodletting as much as the character grwoth. We'll see what the future holds for this series as it has set an immensely high bar for next year, but this inaugural season does indeed live up to the hype, and feels like a kindred spirit with Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite!",,,
Just watch it. It's pretty fascinating. Not perfect by any means but engrossing nonetheless.,,,
"A show in the vein of Lord of the Flies, Squid Game takes a uniquely 2021 approach to the ideas of human desperation, success & survival. It triumphs where many others have failed before by focusing acutely on the struggles of character rather than relying on plot gimmicks (although, kudos to the writers for the boundless creativity present in each episode). The Hunger Games wishes it was this good.",,,
"Video-essayists will surely be unpacking the political underpinnings of these nine episodes for years to come. All that aside, this show's true strengths lie in its exquisitely tense sequences and ability to emotionally invest its audience in even its most deplorable characters.",,,
Absolutely fantastic...1000 times better than the new venom movie and the new James Bond movie. So innovative and creative...brilliant !!!,,,
Wildly overrated. Dragged out for too long. Story has been done many times. Dubbing is the worst I have ever seen. Not a single likeable character. Most predictable ending ever. Would not bother with a second season.,,,
"The ending was really unexpected, maybe season 2 is on its way.",,,
"The 1% taking advantage of and forcing the 99% into lethal games for indulgent means has been a rampant premise targeted at the YA audience for years (Battle Royale, Hunger Games, Maze Runner etc.) Squid Game excels by taking the young adult demographic out of the equation, creating a much more grounded drama that focuses on character stories in a relatively realistic and gritty portrayal. Granted a lot of elements of the show go against this strength and make little sense; like the lack of surveillance in restrooms, (or the fact that they're separate at all) or the ridiculous and almost comically written ""VIPs"" and the art direction sometimes feels too arbitrary and is just there for visual iconography. Also the show thematically wants to push the ideology of equality and ""giving everyone a chance to compete fairly"" but the games tend to over proportionally favor luck which also feels counterintuitive and doesn't deliver a succinct message. Anyway, it's a thrilling watch! Really most enjoyable when the character dramas are a focus of the show.",,,
"Interesting premise. Some moments were annoying / seem to drag on, or seemed a bit cheesy (maybe because of awkward translation?) but I enjoyed it overall.",,,
"It is emotional, well-written and has characters that shake your core at times. A little bit too brutal in my opinion, but the story is interesting and compelling.",,,
"Really good and original. Good acting, better plot and keeps you intrigued throughout. Not sure how you can keep it up with multi seasons but we'll see.",,,
Great character development and innovative dystopian take on south Korean children's games makes this essential viewing,,,
Pretty cool! But I do not understand the people who think it is the best thing in the world..,,,
Did not like it that much. Old wine in a new bottle.,,,
"Korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on Netflix called Squid Game.",,,
"STOP READING THIS REVIEW RIGHT NOW AND GO WATCH IT. SERIOUSLY, STOP IT. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING. STOP READING. GO WATCH IT NOW.",,,
"Squid Game does a great job creating likable and hatable characters. The characters are used well to provoke emotions in the viewer. I will not spill any details, but I will say it's definitely worth the watch. Now on the bad side, since I am an English speaker, I watched this show dubbed in English. The voice acting at times doesn't feel natural to the scene and is overexaggerated. This is not the fault of the writers, but I found myself noticing the disconnect often. Some scenes feel drawn out, I cannot explain without spoiling so that will be all that's said. All in all, this is a great show and I would recommend Squid Game with high regards",,,
"I've only seen one episode, but I can't see what makes it's a binge-worthy show. So far it just seems incredibly stupid. Is the gore and mayhem that I keep reading about really going to make it more watchable?",,,
I LOVE IT!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥,,,
My type of thriller and gore movie. I loved it !,,,

"Just another Korean battle royale. Sometimes good, sometimes bad.",,,
"Its a shallow story with cookie cutter characters that treats its viewers as idiots and in a cheap way uses social issues as a platform for shock value and violence. People act like its the best thing since sliced bred and very original, when in fact its a low effort rip-off of the media that's been around for over 2 decades (Kaiji) and superior in every way. Its ok to pass the time, if you don't mind bad acting, and that show entirely kills little bit of mystery it has in its plot, because it does not let you use your brain to process stuff, everything gets served on a silver platter to the point its insulting to watch. People who have nothing but praise for the show, have extremely bad taste and consume such media like zombies, without giving anything a second thought, and instead just rolling with whatever happens on the screen.",,,
"I liked it, episode II was crazy!",,,
"A very interesting series about how money drives people to do bad. I paced my self by only watching 1-2 episodes a day. By doing this I kept wanting more. Great acting for the most part and a good not great plot. Wasn't a fan of the final part of the police man's story arc and the final episode as a whole. They tease at a second season, but I personally think the show should stick with just this first season. I enjoyed the show as a whole but was disappointed with the way they decided to end it.",,,
"I have to recommend the Squid Game series to you, I was skeptical at first because everyone was talking about it and I rarely like anything from ""commercial"" series and movies but this one is an exception. i'll just say that in the seventh episode i cried like rain , because the series director and the actors touched my soul . After that episode I had to take a cigarette break and ask myself about life . 10/10",,,
"Interesting start, but too slow. Aside from the fact that the entire game is already improbable, there are storylines that are even more improbable.",,,
"The scenery and filming was excellent. But the plot was lazy. If you have seen ""Would you rater"" Then this is just a very long Korean version of that. It got silly plot twists which you can guess immediately. In the beginning it seemed promising but in the end, every bad writers choice was made.",,,
"Starts off cheesy, but It makes you think if you found yourself in that position what would you do. The bad guys are upfront with the rules and the outcome. How do you play?",,,
The first thing that comes to mind to describe the first season of Squid Game is brilliant. Lee-Jung-jae puts in a mind-blowingly good performance as the lead of a show bound to keep you on the edge of your seat until it's conclusion.,,,
"Raw, great performances, in depth story telling with plots and twists. With many social commentaries. And just plain fun and enthralling. Definitely a classic for me.",,,
Not a good tv series at all. Only watched 4 episodes. Couldn't handle anymore. I don't understand the fasination on the series at all.,,,
I had to binge the whole series after watching the first episode. I can't wait for season 2.,,,
After abandoning this after only one episode I'm left scratching my head at the hype surrounding this average-at-best attempt at entertainment.,,,
"The fact that people love this gory, boring, absurd show tells more about the blood-lust and violence loving society we have devolved into. No, there isn't anything ""deep"" or ""metaphorical"" about it. Most episodes are flat-out snooze fests with some really, really, REALLY bad acting. This is really nothing more than a flashy, overrated, glorified snuff film disguised as ""social commentary"". Did I mention the horrific acting? Really a total waste of time with no redeeming qualities. I feel lesser for watching it, and regret the time I wasted doing so.",,,
Amazing and Stunning real life stories,,,
"Very compelling and well made (censored), which seems to be relabeled 'sharp social commentary' now. You need to see the world in the usual tired dichotomy of 'oppressor and oppressed' for the story to resonate. The writer chooses to only build a story in that vein, with no middle ground. Religion is lampooned, wealth and success are scorned, even the 'eyes wide shut' villains are bad western culture caricatures. The hero rejects the wealth he earns and we are supposed to forget he knew fully well what was at stake and how he would need to win? Is he disgusted by the atrocity, or that he cheated what he thought was a feeble old man to win a round? This series isn't designed to uplift. It's designed to help people feel better about living on the lowest rung, like good (censored) should. Maybe I'll choose to view this series as an indictment of professional sports instead. Ordinary people, motivated purely by the dream of great wealth, destroy themselves playing a child's game for the amusement of the people who pay to see them do it. (apparently I'm not supposed to mention a certain German anti-capitalist on this site or my posts won't be allowed)",,,
"Very predictable story line and character arcs. The only suspense and 'twists' and 'turns' were derived by the unfamiliarity with the cultural differences and children's games. Ultimately it's not terrible, but it's not great. I don't quite understand why this is such a global phenomena right now, except from the media hype driving people to watch it.",,,
Epic series..loved the cast!,,,
Awesome. Simply awesome.,,,
"Awful, rubbish, terrible.",,,
"The concept itself is extremely engaging; even a subpar execution would still make for decent entertainment. Squid Game, however, is exceptionally well-executed on all fronts that matter. The concept is simple but effective, making for amazing tension and a great source of drama. When I first saw season 1, I wasn't convinced that it couldn't have just been a miniseries. In hindsight, I've warmed up to the ending - the story needed more time to fully get the point across.",,,
"Going to be honest, I'm glad I stuck at it past episode one. I hear a lot of people say they gave up after half and hour, more fool them; I didn't understand where it was going in the first episode but from that point it grew from strength to strength. A great series. Can't wait for season 2!",,,
"Warning - little spoilers at the end. Top visuals and sound, soundtrack is top-notch, but....... Characters seem to be always in one-dimension - guy that has been d*ck at the beginning, keeps it up to very end. Coward is coward all the time. Story is just simple - nothing unexpected happens, and believe me they tried. Asian actors are mostly great, sometimes feels a bit weird, but white actors at the end - WTF - where did you get those?",,,
The intensity of the Squid Game story is grounded with problems and today reality. The twists of memories and cultural elements are a bit touchy yet relatable. It is beautifully done!,,,
"Not very original, as most of Netflix's originals are, as it was really a combination of overused themes, but drawn out much much longer and similar to Would You Rather. The acting only ramped up around episode 6 and at that point, it had already become quite predictable. It's not particularly brutal like it is made out to be, as the deaths were very quick, just psychologically stimulating to a short degree. People only act as animals do. The ending was a bit of a surprise, but not very well thought out. Multiple aspects were left unexplained, and the ending was a cliffhanger",,,
"A brilliant yet inevitably flawed series, a mesmerizing and bloody social commentary on classism, post-era capitalism told from the Korean perspective.",,,
"This series starting from Episode 1… represents the desensitization of the most brutal imagery. The more we see as a global society - the less impact it has on a moralistic level. Sort of like how we all first reacted when we first heard of a ""drive by shooting""… or ""police brutality ""… and ""a school massacre"". It's absolutely jaw dropping and shocking to watch this show… and as you continue to ""see"" this barbaric murder …,it becomes less shocking. So why watch the second episode and series at all? Because there is good writing… there is good artistic development… and you are so blown away at how intensely bazaar and brutal it is… beckons you to see what's next.",,,
"The worst series, very primitive.",,,
Got suckered in to watch by what I know suspect were fake ratings numbers to make you want to check it out. Cartoonish story & acting and also just not interesting. One more inch closer to cancelling Netflix for lying to me.,,,
"This show was spectacularly written and filmed, I keep rewatching to find things that I missed. The show is rich with hidden themes and metaphors not to mention you get so invested in the characters and their individual struggles. Please please watch it, it's amazing.",,,
looking forward to season 2.,,,
"Its not terrible, but the characters are shallow, and you don't retally care if they live or die. The show is written to mimic reality tv shows, forming teams, alliances, really stupid. It turns violent like a John Wick movie, but not nearly as good. It passes the time, but there is nothing special, innovative, or deep about it. And for many people, that will be enough.",,,
Brutal. Heartwarming. Heartbreaking. Horrendous. Sad. Angry. Disbelief. All of these words cannot do this show justice. It makes Saw look obsolete. I'm on episode 6. Too scared to carry on 🤣 Too hooked - not to carry on. I must make it to the end.,,,
Looking forward to the next season!,,,
"The razor sharp critiques mesh surprisingly well with the entertaining and brutal games, creating a compelling and binge-worthy series that deservedly found a huge international audience.",,,,
Squid Game is a highly thrilling series that keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout.,,,,
“Squid Game” is a social allegory informed by Korean history. There’s more to the game than gambling and violence.,,,,
"There's some great stuff in the show. Episode 6, AKA the marbles game, is a masterclass and there are stellar performances too. Everyone in the main cast is incredible.",,,,
"Squid Game leaves little to complain about and much to be impressed by. As long as the quantity of blood and the depths of the emotional turmoil the show displays aren’t too much for you, there is little reason not to give this gem a watch.",,,,
"Squid Game is effective at pulling you in. By the middle of the first episode, viewers are plunged into a world that’s as repulsive as it is gripping, complete with masked villains and hapless antiheroes ...",,,,
Hypnotic. [Full review in Spanish],,,,
A dark and funny look at the well-known injustices of modern societies. [Full review in Spanish],,,,
"""Squid Game"" is deservedly one of the hottest shows of the year, and it highlights the good streaming can do in regards to breaking down cultural barriers and exposing viewers to masterworks from across the world they would otherwise not have access to.",,,,
"""Squid Game'' is a well-produced thriller with a couple of decent twists and a whole lot of violence.",,,,
"Its messages hit like a sledgehammer to the head, yet this vibrant, vicious series holds a surprisingly big heart at its core. A winning blend of spectacle and sentiment.",,,,
"There is a visceral, primal, can't-look-away feeling to the nine-episode series, which traffics in gore but also deep psychological horror and disturbances.",,,,
"This is a series that needs to be experienced, not discussed or analysed. It is one that will stay on in your mind long after you've watched it.",,,,
It's not the kind of apocalypse story that longs for hopeful human resilience; it's most eloquent on the topics of financial despondence and weaponized nostalgia.,,,,
"Compulsively watchable although, in the end, his dark dystopian story is lightened by transforming his protagonist into yet another hero. Forget it, Jake. It's Netflix.",,,,
"All of it works as an exercise not just in survival of the fittest, but also as a stirring study of the whims of fortune, imbued with all that social commentary.",,,,
"In the end, the devastation left by the game is tangible, leaving the winner in anguish and despair, while those at home are begging for more.",,,,
A masterful show that truly changed the game in storytelling.,,,,
"I'm almost halfway through its nine-episode run, and you know what? It is just about worthy of the hype.",,,,
"Squid Game doesn't delve too deeply - and it's not subtle - but for a visual hammer-blow, this has made waves.",,,,
Macabre and addictive. [Full Review in Spanish],,,,
"It's weird, but becomes increasingly hypnotising as the story progresses. And inevitably, there are plenty of loose ends left over to set up series 2.",,,,
"The originality of the idea, the visual effects and of course, the acting are outstanding and incomparable to anything we have ever seen on television in our lives!",,,,
Netflix's breakout series depicts a world of violent and macabre individualism and desperation.,,,,
"Squid Game is many things, but above all it's top-notch junk TV, to be binged with swivel-eyed abandon.",,,,
"I don't know if anything is ""111 million views instantly"" good but at least Squid Game delivered on the hype, it's if nothing else a great TV series.",,,,
"This very bingeable Korean horror drama may not be a feel good watch, but it sure does feel good to see how internationally popular it has become.",,,,
"Directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, the South Korean import is a diabolical, original parable about money and debt.",,,,
"Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, who spent a decade trying to get the project green-lit and was once so desperate he sold his laptop for cash, will probably have less trouble getting his next script financed.",,,,
"The South Korean TV sensation taps into the universal apprehensions of pressing debt, strained family relations and the longing for a better life.",,,,
"For the most part, writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk's mix of high and low elements like that works incredibly well.",,,,
"It's an amazing piece of work, and I truly applaud creator Hwang Dong-Hyuk on making this mesmerizing, shocking and emotional show.",,,,
"Hwang has created one of the most immersive television worlds since Game of Thrones, with relentless entertainment value and remarkably fleshed-out, sympathetically flawed characters. It's a provocative morality play.",,,,
Totally bingeable.,,,,
"This is a show that plays to Netflix's strengths. Only Netflix are able to have a show that can generate such a buzz globally in literally a matter of days, even if the show is not in the English language.",,,,
"The low-effort concept [and] the pastel palette freckled with blood, Squid Game is a shallow story that uses a social issue as a platform for shocking violence. Yawn.",,,,
"Like Joker, there's a having-it-both-ways insistence that a culture that could create violence is inherently sick and deranged, while playing out a wildly overstated version of sick derangement in a manner designed to be maximally tense and amusing.",,,,
Hwang Dong-hyuk has done a great job of bringing this ghoulishly entertaining series to life,,,,
"In the end, we have a great show about the core of humanity that should be making... Hollywood sweat right about now.",,,,
"Squid Game is a rousing, disturbing, candy-coated, brain matter-splattered experience steeped in societal ennui.",,,,
Squid Game has one of the best first episodes of television I've ever seen. It shows the results you can get by investing in programming from around the world.,,,,
Is there a battle more emblematic of this moment than that between individual rights and social responsibilities?,,,,
"Squid Game is smart, well-written, and has a talented cast that takes an often violent story and makes it emotionally resonate.",,,,
"It's just really great telly. It's tightly written, each episode packed with enough pace to make it truly binge worthy.",,,,
"As social commentary, it mostly works. As a show about brutal, larger-than-life games to the death, it also mostly works... But as far as final acts go, Squid Game stumbled pretty badly.",,,,
"What writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk has done principally involves serving old wine in a new bottle. Seen that way, ""Squid Game"" presents a visually arresting variation on themes seen plenty of times before, which include tapping into the class divide.",,,,
[It] never makes its action look glamorous. Its intensity comes from feeling that you've gone beyond the end point of a chain of absurdist logic and you really might not want to see what comes next.,,,,
It really is an excellent distillation of how predatory capitalism works.,,,,
"What you've got in Squid Game, for all its now-notorious darkness, is a brave, dark, ambitious tale, at times moving and at times terrifying. Its power is in its understanding that money is survival.",,,,
"Debt to a cruel system is inescapable and dehumanizing, the show constantly reminds us. But beneath the hyper-violence, it also suggests that our obligations to other people can be a source of meaning, compassion, and --just maybe -- salvation.",,,,
"Dark, twisted, and surprisingly emotional, Squid Game is a quick bloody yet visually stunning must watch.",,,,
Craptacular.,,,,
"It does say a lot about human nature, friendship, cruelty, and the way modern societies have abused its poorer citizens. [Full review in Spanish]",,,,
"The greater anticapitalist critique of Squid Game almost entirely toothless following any serious analysis...I am unimpressed with the messaging, and am confident this drama won't stand the test of time.",,,,
"A twisty, fast-paced, action-packed show whose episodes end in killer cliffhangers-in other words, the ultimate binge bait.",,,,
Netflix's Korean thriller is on track to be the most watched series in the streamer's history. It's also giving people nightmares.,,,,
"As far as sociopolitical statements go, you also couldn't engineer a better strike to the millennial and Gen Z nerves than a show where characters have to perform useless tasks in order to marginally improve their luck of the draw.",,,,
"Squid Game lays out its strengths early. The cast are terrific, the action is inventive and brutal and the influences are worn shamelessly.",,,,
"This unflinching look at how desperation changes us makes Squid Game as moving as it is exciting. It searches for an answer to one terrifying question: When pushed, what are your limits? What would you do? Its chilling brutality has us hooked.",,,,
"Equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing, it's a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer. It's one of the most unique things you'll watch this year -- and maybe ever.",,,,
"Squid Game culminates emotionally in episode six, centered on a childlike game of marbles that's paced with excruciating slowness as the main characters have to make, literally, life or death decisions with one another.",,,,
The human aspect of this show shines over the morbid. For some reason we are addicted to the unmeasured violence and the isolation and behavioral analysis of human beings in movies and TV shows. Recipe for success. [Full review in Spanish],,,,
"Ignore some glaring red herrings, plot holes, occasional shoddy pacing and in-your-face gore, and Squid Game is worth bingeing.",,,,
"""Squid Game"" is fairly thoughtful, and the fact that there is no sexual component to the violence is something in its favor.",,,,
The ins and outs of the games are thrilling.,,,,
"Squid Game marks its own territory, first with its especially savage premise and the constant tension around life-or-death scenarios, and second, by focusing on each character's decisions, as they struggle to choose between survival and humanity.",,,,
"Stylish, gripping, and well-acted by an excellent ensemble cast, Squid Game will keep you pressing play, no matter how scared you get.",,,,
"Squid Game is thrilling and original and full of gripping emotional twists-and despite being a big-budget Netflix show, it also feels subversive in our current media landscape.",,,,
"Truth be told, Squid Game is not for the faint of heart, but -- like some of the best genre content -- there's more going on between the kill or be killed.",,,,
Some predictable plot points distract from the fine acting and the high-minded concept. Fans of dystopian thrillers will enjoy this series. Sensitive or younger viewers should avoid this one.,,,,
"This series does not hold back. Squid Game is unabashedly violent, chaotic, and visceral.",,,,
Squid Games takes a fresh idea and spins it into a thrilling drama; we hope it continues to build the tension we saw in the last 20 minutes throughout the season.,,,,
"It's a strange, violent, disturbing adventure, and if that sounds like something you'd like, I can't recommend Squid Game enough.",,,,
"Squid Game doesn't offer an escape from the horrors of the real world; within its limitations as a fictional drama, it gives us something far rarer: an affirmation that they exist, and that we're not alone in finding them nightmarish.",,,,
"Overall, this is still a savagely entertaining slam dunk from Netflix Korea, which is likely to be embraced around the world as its predecessors were.",,,,
"Thematic intelligence aside, Squid Game is also a white-knuckle watch, thanks to its visceral competition element.",,,,
"Aside from being stretched just a touch too thin in spots, I'd say [Squid Game] deserves all the praise it's going to get.",,,,
