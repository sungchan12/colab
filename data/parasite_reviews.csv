review_text
"Une p?pite cor?enne. Un excellent moment pass? pendant le visionnage. Un film ? voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du probl?me des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'?tre, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine tr?s bien et ne se pr?cipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
"Parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases Bong Joon-ho's exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance. This film deserves every accolade it has received. **Directing & Cinematography:** Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous and purposeful. Every shot serves the narrative, particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions - from the Parks' elevated mansion to the Kims' semi-basement dwelling. The camera movements are deliberate, creating tension through simple pans and tilts. The rain sequence is cinematographically stunning, using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor. The production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic. **Script & Storytelling:** The screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion. What begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller, then a horror film, without ever feeling disjointed. The script's genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently - each conversation serves multiple purposes, advancing plot while developing relationships and themes. **Overall Impact:** Parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary. It explores class inequality with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity. The film's universal themes transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly Korean. The pacing is expertly controlled, building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion. This is cinema at its finest - technically brilliant, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant."
Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
"A well-crafted mix of suspenseful drama and dark humour with a dose of social commentary thrown on top, this is one of the best foreign language films of recent times."
"An Unforgettable Masterpiece... A Cinematic Rollercoaster That Gets Under Your SkinReview Body:It is a rare occasion when a film manages to be laugh-out-loud funny, nail-bitingly tense, and heart-wrenchingly tragic?often all at once. Bong Joon Ho's brilliant ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it is a complete cinematic experience, a masterfully conducted symphony of conflicting emotions that dance together in perfect, unsettling **** story begins with a deceptively simple premise: a poor, crafty family hatches an ingenious plan to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy one. What starts as a sharp and wildly entertaining black comedy about a heist soon morphs, slowly and methodically, into something else entirely. Director Bong uses every tool in his cinematic arsenal?from the stunning cinematography that turns architecture into a main character, to the razor-sharp script where not a single word is wasted?to build a world where you feel everything is about to collapse at any **** ensemble cast performance is nothing short of magnificent; every actor delivers a flawless performance, adding layers of humanity and complexity to characters that could have easily been stereotypes.Without revealing any of its stunning surprises, ""Parasite"" is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is bold, incredibly entertaining, and profoundly thought-provoking. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to the movies in the first **** personal rating: 8.5/10 ? An absolute must-see for any lover of true cinema."
Le surjeu asiatique ne m'accroche toujours pas... Et puis je ne trouve pas vraiment d'int?r?t a cette histoire sanguinaire. Les personnages n'?volue pas et puis flemme d'?crire un vrais avis je viens de le voir et ?a m'a laiss? de marbre.
"Em Parasita, Bong Joon-ho salda a conta entre forma e conte?do: o roteiro engenhoso costura humor negro e cr?tica social de forma indissoci?vel. A fam?lia Kim, interpretada com camadas de ambi??o e vulnerabilidade, ecoa em cada c?modo da casa Park, meticulosamente fotografada para refor?ar o abismo econ?mico.O filme acelera sem atropelar, revelando reviravoltas que soam inevit?veis apenas depois que acontecem. A fluidez entre cenas de humor, suspense e drama culmina num desfecho inesquec?vel, capaz de chocar e emocionar na mesma batida. ? uma aula de como abordar temas complexos ? desigualdade, facetas humanas, privil?gio ? sem cair em didatismo.Parasita ? um marco cultural e cinematogr?fico, comprovando que o entretenimento pode (e deve) carregar uma mensagem contundente."
"Parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship, and with good reason. Its cinematography is carefully composed, its symbolism is deliberately placed, and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity. A high level of directorial control is evident throughout, and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence. That said, an emotional connection was difficult to establish. The shifts in tone ? though clearly intended ? were experienced as uneven, and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism. Characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human, which made empathy harder to sustain. While the film¡¯s artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood, the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey. Parasite may be admired for what it achieves, but it was not personally found to be engaging. In short, worth watching, hard to connect with."
"I don't know why but i got soo easily attached to the story also weird film. very very weird. Well deserved of ""Best Film 2019"" tho."
"Absolute dog****. You mean to tell me that this stupid 'artsy' film won best picture. This is the wrong foreign film to win this prestigious award. In fact, 1917 is a lot more gripping and carries an important social message about war. Parasite is easily Bong-joon ho's worst film in his entire career with absurd tonal inconsistencies, horrendous storytelling and a not-so-intriguing twist at the end."
"Com certeza um dos melhores filmes que j? assisti (se n?o for o melhor). Esse filme ? genial em muitos aspectos, mas principalmente por contar uma hist?ria de forma muito natural que voc? consegue refletir sobre tantos aspectos. Narrativamente ele ? dividido em 4 arcos: 1- Conhecemos a fam?lia Kim, uma fam?lia muito pobre e malandra que vive numa casa favelada 2- Atrav?s da indica??o do seu amigo, Kevin (o filho da fam?lia Kim) consegue um emprego de prof de ingl?s da filha da fam?lia Park que mora numa mans?o luxuosa. Por?m os Kim usam sua labia, malandragem e falsifica??o para demitir a empregada e o motorista dos Park e colocar no lugar o pai, a m?e e a filha dos Kim, sem eles saberem que s?o uma fam?lia. Esse arco ? pessoalmente meu favorito, porque ele ? bem relaxante, inteligente, leve e bem dirigido. 3- Quando os Park viajam para um acampamento, a fam?lia Kim decide fazer uma comemora??o na mans?o, quando no meio da noite, numa cena muito tensa, aparece a antiga empregada dizendo que precisa pegar algo que esqueceu no por?o e ? revelado que quem est? morando num bunker secreto no por?o ? o marido dela que deve para agiotas e n?o pode sair de l?. O casal tmb descobre o segredo da fam?lia Kim, as 2 fam?lias brigam mas os Kims levam a melhor e trancam eles l? ao mesmo tempo que os Park avisam que o acampamento deu errado e est?o voltado numa cena arrepiante. E o pior ? que no meio da noite os Kim v?o embora sorrateiramente e quando voltam sua casa est? sendo imundada por uma tempestade. Essa parte do filme tamb?m ? excelente. 4- Final - Os Park decidem dar uma festa pro filho mimado deles (sendo que os j? abalados Kim que tem que preparar tudo), mas no meio da festa, Kevim desce para o por?o (n?o ? explicado direito pq) e ? atacado pelo homem que deve pra agiotas, ele pega uma faca e tenta matar todos da fam?lia Kim, matando a filha deles, mas a m?e dos Kim consegue mata-lo, mas na confus?o o Sr. Kim fica chocado enquanto o Park d? ordens para ele com sua filha morrendo nos bra?os e v? ele tampando o nariz do cheiro do lunatico e surta e acaba esfaqueando o Sr. Park e fugindo para o pr?prio bunker que o lunatico vivia. O filho (Kevin), sonha em resgatar seu pai comprando a casa, mas isso jamais poder? acontecer e ele termina o filme como come?ou, fazendo embalagens de pizza. O final ? o ?nico ponto fraco do filme, ele n?o ? ruim, mas ? meio do nada que tudo acontece, principalmente o Sr. Kim esfaquear o Sr. Park, acho que poderiam ter dado um motivo concreto pra isso acontecer, como ele puxando ele da filha morta e exigindo que dirigisse. Outra coisa que eu n?o gosto do final ? que o desfecho focou 100% na fam?lia Kim, a fam?lia Park sequer aparece, poderiam ter botado uma ceninha pelo menos pra mostrar como ficaram depois desse trauma. E por causa desses 2 pontos que eu n?o gostei do final que eu dei 9 ao inv?s de 10 para essa obra-prima. De pontos positivos esse filme tem muitos, ? tanta coisa para refletir montada numa hist?ria t?o boa que chega a arrepiar. Temos toda a quest?o do parasita, quem ? o parasita? No come?o parece que a fam?lia Kim mas depois parece que ? o lun?tico. Depois temos toda critica social, do contraste e da desigualdade. Apesar disso, seria leviano dizer que a fam?lia Park s?o os vil?es porque eles n?o tratam mal os Kim e os Kim que enganam eles e armam para os funcion?rios deles Temos tamb?m cen?rios lind?ssimos no filme, a mans?o dos Park faz um contraste absurdo com o barraco dos Kim. Na mans?o, ? tudo limp?ssimo, lindo, entra muita luz solar, enquanto o barraco n?o entra luz, ? sujo, cheio de isentos e mal-cheiroso Outra coisa que merece ser destacada, ? como a hist?ria ? bem constru?da, tudo que acontece de importante tem um foreshadowing, o Sr. Park dizendo que ""o problema da ex-empregada ? que ela comia por 2"", o Sr. Park diversamente reclamando do cheiro dos Kim (que culmina na morte dele) O filme tamb?m tem cenas maravilhosas, como depois de perderem tudo por causa do alagamento, a madame, inocentemente sem saber fala que a chuva ? boa porque limpa o c?u e a cena dos Kim correndo pra arrumar toda bagun?a porque os Park est?o chegando no 3¡Æ arco."
"Parasite is a masterclass in directing and screenwriting. Bong Joon Ho's direction is meticulous, using every frame to build tension and highlight social themes. The script is brilliantly layered, seamlessly blending dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. The dialogue is sharp and the narrative structure keeps you engaged from start to finish. Both the directing and script work together to create a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills. What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."
"Film with a particular and functional atmosphere. The plot is good, not banal and not predictable and with an excellent development. Overall a good film and a good story really appreciable but nothing sensational"
"It's ok, not bad, but certainly not great. Very over-rated, presumably because of it's Oscar. Some decent enough acting, although the storyline is very predictable quite early on. Worth a watch I guess, although I wouldn't rush to see it again!"
"As a huge fan of Snowpiercer, I had incredibly high hopes for this film. Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?Parasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?It's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come **** fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.What little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future. Not the kind experience I'm hoping for at the cinema."
"o filme ? meio lento mas os personagens lhe cativam, ver a familia se ajudando e usando de seus talentos para conseguir se infiltrar na casa ? algo muito interessante."
Eu n?o sei como uma porcaria dessas consegue receber 4 oscars. Filme n?o serve nem para passar em uma sess?o da **** de t?o ruim.
Godlike show that deserves its praise. No question!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing story and setting. The pacing and ending are masterpieces
"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, na?ve, white collar household. Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows. The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
"An amazing movie that keeps getting crazier and crazier until the very end. It starts as something, then evolves into something else, and then into something else. It is an amazing story of a poor family that turns into an amazing horror movie about a poor family. It needs a watch."
"Incendiary filmmaking. A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented. The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights. The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results. The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory. Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft. There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away. The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear. Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."
I've never tried Asian movies but my friend recommended me this movie. But this one was better than some Hollywood movies. It made me think about poor side of the world and how they struggle day to day until the day they die. It made feel sorry for those poor people and really encouraged me to help those who need help and support. I started helping local poor people with my friend. Highly recommend this movie.
"After watching the trailer, it seemed like a movie made to keep watching the movie with simple plot, no serious disturbing things, and once you start watching the movie, you understand the plot and wait for what will happen after this event. After watching the movie, there may be movies that end in such a way that I thought it would end like this."

"It¡¯s an interesting movie, it seemed to me like a very pathetic family amazing movie"
"Parasita ? um cl?ssico instant?neo, o melhor filme do s?culo 21 e um dos melhores de todos os tempos!"
I enjoyed watching this film. It does a great job at build up and tension. Nice solid 8/10
Masterpiece. A gift for Humanity. Do you want to see what's inequality about ? Take a look. Enjoy.
It starts off slow. Almost decided to watch something else. I read other people¡¯s reviews and had some patience. It just gets crazier and crazier in a good way. Solid film.
"A very stylish film with lots of funny moments, but I have to admit that I felt a little underwhelmed after all the hype. That's on me, not the film. This was very good, but no more."
"If Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer) hasn't already solidified himself as one of the greatest living directors, then Parasite removes any last doubt. This masterfully crafted story about class discrepancy is a must-see. Just make every attempt to avoid spoilers before going in."
"A brilliant and thought-provoking movie that explores the themes of class, inequality, and social mobility. It¡¯s a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think deeply about the world we live in. The film is a must-see for anyone interested in the art of cinema."
"Excellent movie. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning"
"Masterpiece. The film is at times funny, poignant, original, thrilling. A social satire that also hits home."
Like **** ****ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
It starts out like a fun comedy. Then the movie just does a **** 360 and it turns into a thriller.
A brilliant film that is equal parts hilarious and disturbing. So glad that it won Best Picture.
This masterpiece is one of the best films I have ever seen in my entire life. I had watched it more than three times and I'm thinking of rewatching it at 4k BluRay.
"Not nearly as good as the Rating says it is. Its about a family of crappy, dirty, slobs that are squatters. Literally thats it. Oh they accidently kill people or something. Lame."
"Mindblowing. This movie catches your attention from the beggining to the very end, and the performance of the actors is brilliant. Definitely a must-see."
"This is my favorite movie of all time for several reasons. 1, I saw it in theaters with my dad, and he made all the appropriate grunts a father does when they enjoy something. His approval means everything to me. Now that I think of it, that's the only reason."
"A masterpiece of modern cinema. Sequences are so well put together. Extremely intense film. A critique on the social structure of todays society. Characters, plot and cinematography are all outstanding. One of my favourite films ever."
"Even though the plot isn't really something different, the way it's developed and the feeling the movie transmits is what makes the movie great, with's a rather simple plot even though crazy plot twists anyways transmit crazy feelings with plot twists such as the killing of the house owner the father for years living like an animal. And the vague glance of hope is shown at the end. It has important subjects like the class division, the people with higher socioeconomic status watching others as inferiors, and the insane obsession of the mentally filled with the houseowner his idealization."
God bless Joon-Ho for his unique storytelling in which he finally deserved the awards for. You will not be disappointed by every twists & turns this film takes (thanks to his style!).
"Absolute bonkers of a film. With the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror, director Bong Joon-ho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative, set designs, cinematography, and soundtracks, which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story. Parasite (2019) is another great addition to Bong's filmography. Although, I do feel that it is one of his more accessible films, I could not stop thinking about this film every day."
"An amazing thriller, keeps you on the edge of the seat from second pinch. Ending albeit good, could have been better to match the quality of the remaining movie."
"I loved this movie, so many layers, and some unexpected scenes. Maybe not for everyone, if you are looking for something you don't want to think about. For me masterpiece."
A great movie and critique of capitalist class division. Would have been 10 but the ending sequence/twist seems rushed.
"the plot, the acting and the camera work are all excellent. a carefully crafted movie that might hit the spot for oblivious watchers but, most of all, is the gift that keeps on giving for the attentive ones"
"Parasite is haunting, beautiful, strange, ecletic and a powerful drive into human psyche. It is brilliant and I got nothing much to say because it already has been said. In 10 years this will be the best film of all time, it will have transcended and become the art to be studied and glorified when we're gone. There will be schools and futurisitic climates investigating the jewels and there'll be political decisions given according to this gem. I have spoken, the prophet."
"Dark humor, violent thriller, and much more in a social commentary which will shock you in your seat. Parasite is one of the best movies to date, deserving of numerous awards, Oscars and nominations. A cinematic masterpiece is an understatement for this film."
"A Must Watch movie. I am now a Korean movie series fan after watchinv Squid Games. Their writing , acting and casting, is so refreshing, the scriot so unpredictable. Unlike predictable American movies shoving Woke topics in EVERY script, its just sickening, Korean movies are no nonesense, tell the story as it is"
"Mas todo filme coreano era meia bomba pra mim, at? eu ver esse daqui mesmo com essas atua??o exagerada deles o filme ? muito legal e todo mundo que eu recomendei gostou tb se eu tivesse como colocar figurinha do Will ia ser o ""Po?tico"""
Slightly overrated but nonetheless a great movie. Must see. Nine out of ten.
"I liked the film, i thnik it's th? best film of 2019. everything is efficient."
didnt like it. i can see why its a good movie but its just wasnt my cup of coffee.
Parasite is a must see film. A great storyline about the Kim family who one by one begin to work for a wealthy family to turn their lives around from their struggling life. Secrets reveal themselves!
"A clever, original story that intertwines drama, comedy and thriller elements brilliantly along with a heavy dose of social commentary."
"Parasite raises the bar of filmmaking with spectacular writing and immersive audiences with stunning visual metaphorical architecture, into a familiar world of our own, sifting through the social selfishness of our society. Also throwing away the satire genre¡¯s usual ways, transcending deeper into the world of grim, depressing black comedy that highlights the lack of brightness in our everyday struggles not with diseases, not with evil monsters, not with a lack of food and water supply, but out struggles with people. And the struggles of classes fitting into this world of deceit, lies and brutal honesty."
"With a great mundial attention, Parasite surprise evertyone win 4 orcars against favorites movies like 1917 (Sam Mendes) and The Irishman (Martin Scorcese), and all of this is not for nothing: Parasite is a refletion about politics scenario about misery, social inequality and other social problems that aren't be seen, mainly in a country like South Korea that is always showed like a technology and science power without any social problem (that is deny in Bong Joon-ho film). Like as all movie that talk about humanities contrast and inequality, Parasite is a relation between Kim family and Park family: the fisrt lives in a house basement and the second family lives in a beautiful and big mansion in a elite neighbourhood. In addition focus in scenes that show the both ambients, the movie has another way to show the inequality between Kim and Park: Kim and Park are two of three of most popular and communs surnamens is South Korea, however, Kim is most commun (21% of koreans) than Park (9%). The contrast in the reality not only in South Korea, but alround the world, is not realized by Kim family when they are work in many funtions in Park mansion, as like they are part of the Park family. The lack of class awareness in a group that feel privileged by an elite that always oppressed is showed when Choong-sook say ""she isn't poor"" to Moon-gwang, the last Park housekepper, when she founds Moon-gwang's husband in basement. There'is a discussion about is the ""parasite"" in movie is about Kim family, that lives in Park home illegaly, or about Park family, that explore the work of Kim with the inequality. Actuallity, the parasite is about the actions of the both family and, in same time, is the envy, the greed and the preconception that kill Kim- jeong and Nathan Park. Therefore, Parasite has a many interpretations about an only mensage All of the adventure vivenced by Kim started with a rock brought by Min, Ki-woo's friend, that is an amulet very commun in asian countries that bring lucky to families. This object is very important to undestand the movie because many events in movies is about it and it construct slowly the social context of movie: The first event is a Choong-sook commentary when Min brings the amulet, when she say: ""It would be better if is was food"", showing that the basic necessites is most importante than religion. The second event is when Ki-woo go down the basement to give the amulet to Moon-gwang and Geun-sae like a gift, but the man almost kill the boy blow to the head, and the third, and the last, event about this amulet is when the rock is returned to river, like Kim family is returned to misery after the happening in Dae-song party. In any moment in the movie, the amulet is showed like a religious object that can save somebody of poorness and misery, but is showed only like a material object, the same manner that capitalism sees the world and the same manner that inequality and poorness is in the world, a fisical and real problem. As Kim-Ki-taek said: ""That's the reason that people can't be have a plan. Without plan, nothing can't be wrong""."
"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it¡¯s not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film¡¯s message is a little on the nose but I don¡¯t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film¡¯s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film¡¯s story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It¡¯s so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it¡¯s always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I¡¯m using the word tension a lot but that¡¯s what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."
----------------------------------8.0/10-----------------------------------
I'd give it a 10 if I didn't feel like the climax was too abrupt. Everything else was great.
one of the best movies I have seen. This movie is very stressful and you don't get bored during the whole movie.
"Togo is without a doubt a surprise hit, in my opinion. When it comes to dog centric films, I tend to not watch them because let¡¯s just be honest - most of them are sad. Beautiful, but sad. Togo may look like just another Disney dog movie, but it is so much more. This film blew me away from start to finish. And one really interesting fact about this film is it IS based on a true story. I even fact checked the movie after and was floored to find how truly faithful this movie is to the real events. If you grew up with the animated film Balto, I can¡¯t recommend the watch more, it takes the story of a dog mushing adventure that we loved as kids but made for the whole family - and especially us adults. Willem Dafoe again proves his worth as an actor, giving a beautiful performance and Julianne Nicholson was a brilliant cast to back his character up. Give it a watch - you don¡¯t be disappointed."
Die Aufmachung des Films ist sehr gut. Interessante Sozialkritik. Gegen Ende wird es immer bluter (etwas zu blutig in meinem Geschmack) und der Schluss an sich doch etwas sehr an den Haaren herbeigezogen.
"a must see for movie watchers with good taste for good movies. if you like bad movies, avoid this one at all cost. $$$$"
"I was really curious about the movie. I'm not used to watch acclaimed movies or a lot of satires but I'm still open to various genres and types of movies. Parasite is a lot of things at the same time and it's orchestration is perfect. I knew it would touch social classes, I knew the end was something but I still didn't know at all how it would have a shocking ending but I still was surprised and enthralled by what I had seen. A superb film, great satire I don't think I even got to appreciate its depth"
Parasite is a modern masterpiece that depicts the harmful social divide and its affects on the characters in the movie.
"Very nice. ?nteresting story, good acting. You should watch this. You will not regret."
"Way too shallow and savage to be funny, there's no meaningful message underlying so it adds nothing to awareness. Boring and psychopathic."
Director {Bong Joon-Ho} has done it again with a captivating and extraordinary film. Leaving me questioning if the real world is actually like this! Not only is the climax risen to a new level but the jaw dropping ending left me shook.
"phenomenal, involves all genres of cinema, and in a fantastic way; like I¡¯ve never seen before."
"Normally I'm not much into Korean entertainment. The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG. So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched. Parasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house. Things don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hiding The only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal. Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come."
this movies is a 10 this movies is a 10 this movies is a 10 this movies is a 10
this film is something else personally i think its the best film of 2019 All the characters have dept and the story is unbelievable but the acting makes it seem absolutely possible. great
"A stark, unapologetic, ****, and engrossing film about 2 families and their differences in their respective social classes. As the director states, the film is best experienced fresh. Therefore nothing more than my recommendation of the film will be made. It is absolutely, must-see cinema and will forever (aside from its incredible cultural impact) inspire film-makers and screenwriters. A true master class of film-making at play here and the easiest 10/10 I can give."
"'Parasite' [Dir. Bong Joon Ho, 2019, South Korea]: The Novelty Of Reading Subtitles. I think some foreign language films become overrated due to many movie-watchers not being book-readers, or, the novelty of reading whilst 'watching' (glancing up between dialogue) is probably where people are deriving pleasure. You're barely able to watch the film while you're reading the subtitles at the bottom of the screen, so you're unable to judge the acting and cinematography. They're speaking in a foreign language too, so it's impossible to rate the delivery of lines. I doubt this film is rated as highly by Koreans. Parasite is good, quite original, but certainly overrated. The story is reasonably straight forward, and not the mysterious thriller the original trailer advertises it to be. The comedy only exist as humorous moments that can exist in everyday life, whilst the drama isn't believable or impactful. Who is the titular 'parasite'? Well, we can assume all the people working for the wealthy family are the parasites. It's a quick development of the plot when an entire impoverished family rapidly gain employment at the rich family's lavish home through skilled deception, skills which seem unlikely in origin according to earlier scenes. Of course, their new source of income goes off-rails as quickly as it had begun, but certainly not in a deep, 'Hitchc*ckian', or clever way. Many elements of the film are not fleshed out or are dead ends: The family went from folding pizza boxes to being master conmen; What was the relevance of the ornamental rock?; Why did the young man basically adopt the life of his friend?; Why was it briefly implied the rich man didn't love his wife?; What were the drugs he mentioned he'd buy her?; What became of the boy's deciphered Morse code?; How did the young man send a letter to his father?; Was the end a dream? So, Parasite is not a funny film, and not particularly thrilling, dramatic, clever, or suspenseful. The (music) score is ok, but it's hard to comment on the acting as it's a foreign language movie, and the photography is hard to judge when you're reading the almost non-stop text at the bottom of the screen. There's no particular moral to the story to learn, other than, maybe, not pushing your luck, and tolerating an unpleasant smell. However, from the originality, and what you can discern from the plot, it's still an engaging film - even if that's largely from the novelty of reading subtitles. 7/10 - Not as good as Cinema Paradiso [1988, Director's Cut, 173 min]."
"Took me too long to review this one as I forgot to review it. Don't need to say much more then best film of 2020 and very deserving of all the awards it won. Was so into the film I forgot at parts that I was even reading subtitles, it **** you in from the very beginning and doesnt give up."
"It is one of the best movies I have seen in the last five years. With a well structured script, the film does not lose sight of its message by telling an entertaining and uncomfortable story at the same time."
"I can undoubtedly say Parasite was one of the most touching movies I have watched. I was not expecting a foreign language, occurring in a foreign society would affect me so much. Since engaging with another society far from your culture is rather perplexing especially in a movie But, every element of this movie was so well put together that dragged the audience from the beginning to the end without a blink. The ending was not maybe what viewers anticipated from the beginning, but it wasn't too far out of sight either. The soundtracks were meticulously composed with a purpose for each scene to convey the emotion that the director wants to the audience. Because Parasite has played with all my emotions from happiness to sorrow throughout the film and the soundtracks along with the actors were exceptional in deliberating this story to us. This movie pictures the extreme gap between the classes in a society. The story begins with a family who is struggling to make ends meet by folding pizza boxes and selling them and live in half of the basement in a very poor neighbourhood. Their son is taking over a friend's job to teach English in a very wealthy house. The family one by one find their way into the wealthy family household by working for them, from cook to chauffeur. The movie started as a comedy then shifts to a thriller, drama and eventually a bit of horror. The movie is shedding light on the problems of society that is rarely talked about. It has made me realize there are struggles in the society that we don't see. The working poor and underclass are not right in front of us. We are all living in one place, but they are the ones who have to crumple in half a basement with the very poor living condition. TIf you want an eye-opening movie that shows you the brutalities of a capitalist world, then this is the movie for you. It makes you wonder what else is happening in a society that you have no slightest idea? It gives you insights into rarely discussed struggles in societies that don't care much about the poor. I don't want to spoil it more than I did already, but I have deeply been thinking about the effect of society on people. What one might do to reach the top? How much this gap between classes put pressure on lower classes? This movie has brilliantly pictured the answer to these questions."
"Second half of this movie has a lot of brawling which I found tiresome. But, this is the type of movie that rewards viewers who pay close attention. While it is sympathetic towards the poor family, it doesn't get into what would happen if the tables were turned. Would the formerly poor family behave like the rich family in the film? Parasite goes only so far as to suggest Maybe. It's a rambunctious movie with considerable underlying subtlety. Remarkable."
This movie will pull a fast one on you if you let it. If the parasite family are willing to work geniuses why do they find themselves on the low ebb of life? If the parasited on family is so lazy and stupid why do they find themselves on the opposite end of the social stick? World is full of smart but lazy and hard-working but stupid people. The meager rest is mostly comprised of both lazy and stupid. If you want to work and are smart to boot believe me society will find a way to appreciate you.
"It's an interesting movie, hard to compare to anything else. It has its own unique style. Thrilling and funny at the same time. Has some society critical messages included. Anyway the characters and plot don't feel comprehensible. It's an interestic movie but no 'must see' for me. Overall I can't understand this huge hype at all, even so I am a big fan of movies with an unexpectable plot."
"The reason this movie is so good is because of its symbols. Without symbols, a movie can never reach the depths of emotion that it might. The rock, for example, is a really good symbol. I think it represents the family's aspirations for wealth, and also represents a blessing that will bring them wealth (as Min said). It becomes a powerful metaphor when you see the basement dwelling guy use it to bash Ki-woo (the son)'s head. What I think this means is that poor people often sabotage other poor people's chances for wealth (the basement dweller trying to kill Ki-woo). And sometimes it's our own dreams (like the rock) that destroy us. The metaphor becomes even more meaningful when you see that the rock was fake (as rocks can't float in water, yet this rock floated in the sewage when the house was flooded), meaning that the ""blessing that was going to give them material wealth"" was never actually going to happen. This poor family will stay poor forever, as Ki-taek (the father) represents. Ki-taek was constantly reminded of his place in society by his smell. No matter how much he tried to fit in with the rich family as their driver, he always smelled bad. And that solidified his place as a poor person. When Mr. Park (the rich family's father) was going to get the keys from under the basement dweller's body, he was absolutely repulsed by the smell of poverty that the basement dweller emitted. Ki-taek, with his daughter (and the family's only chance of being rich, as she was the only one who fit in with the rich people) dying beneath him, finally snapped at seeing this aversion to the smell of poor people. Because to Ki-taek, this disgust that Mr. Park displayed towards the ""poor smell"", represented the disgust that Mr. Park had for poor people. Including him. So he killed him out of rage and desperation. These are just some of the symbols in Parasite. There were also other good elements in the movie. The acting, suspense, plot, visual design, sound design and camerawork were all great. But the symbols, for me, are what solidify the movie's rating as a 10. In the words of Ki-woo, ""Wow, this is so metaphorical."""
"Definitely the best film of 2019, and one of the top Best Picture winners ever."
The latest installment in the Emperors new clothes. A hideous endeavor thru and thru.
"Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. The social commentary is incredibly relevant and will resonate with you long after viewing. It¡¯s probably the best social commentary in a film I¡¯ve seen. The cinematography is great, with deep symbolism and meaning in every shot. The writing is amazing, with great performances and characters. The film follows the Kim family, a poor family of four, who begin to leech off of the Park family, a naive rich family, by slowly taking over their house. It¡¯s a terrific film, with so many pertinent lines of dialogue and overarching themes, complemented by a story filled to the brim with thought provoking allegory. I couldn¡¯t recommend this film enough."
"Very charming and clever first part. The individual pieces of the film were put together well and really wanted more. In addition, the movie was pretty funny at first. Unfortunately, the film loses its thread a bit in the middle and has a rather boring and weak scene that I would have liked to have seen in a different way. But then the film picks up speed again and takes strange twists and turns and ends in a crazy finale. A very clever drama that takes a slightly different path."
"Breathtaking film, very tense moments and really surprised me. Great criticism about socioeconomic inequality through the lives of two completely different families and the ambition for a status. Unexpected end and a real turnaround."
Shoplifters was a better movie by all accounts. This is just class warfare for no particular reason. But I guess it references the differing impact of Climate Change on the classes so...Oscar?
"""Parasite"" is fantastic. It's clever. It's funny. It's disturbing. And yes, there is a powerful underlying theme of the divide between rich and poor. But the latter is so deftly weaved into the fabric of the story, you really don't think about it much until a fateful scene before the last act. It fully deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and Director. If only for the peach fuzz fight scene."
"I really enjoyed this movie, it had interesting events, funny moments, tragic moments - everything. At first I thought maybe since it has Oscar I might not like it as sometimes they end up quite boring, but this one was worth it."
"A really interesting premise and first half is squandered in the second half as red herring plot points are dangled before us, then discarded in favour of an incongruous, stabby finale."
This movie is a phenomenal experience that explores the ways in which people of the 1% status look down upon those in the lower class. It also infuses this with strong elements of horror and thriller that elevate the movie even higher as we unravel more of the story. Throughout much of the film my eyes were wide with some of the twist reveals and the horrific things that end up happening. This is definitely a must watch film because of the masterclass in film making put on display from Bong Joon Ho. It is fully deserving of your time if you are looking to get into foreign language films.
"Hello. If you enjoyed seeing 'Parasite', please do this survey! This is a survey on the translation of 'Parasite'. Thank you. ****/AboQUfo5bYPueFt19"
"Quite literally one of the greatest movies of all time. Likely to stand with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and Shawshank Redemption in terms of quality and importance, however to read a review before watching the movie is a disservice to both yourself and the movie, and I implore you to see the movie first, before reading any other potential spoiler filled review."
It¡¯s so f**king good. Might actually be this best film of the last 25 years.
"Terrifying film- such a suspenseful way to learn that poor people exist. Thankfully now I know better than to trust the poors, who I know from this movie will not only infiltrate my home and live in my basement like bridge trolls, but also knife me to death if I make fun of how they smell."
"Imoressionante. Plots incr?veis, cr?ticas excelentes, narrativa fenomenal, esse filme realmente me emocionou, o melhor que j? assisti."
This is how you do a movie had me on the edge of my sit. I was shaking on the tense scenes. This MOVIE IS BRILLIANT
"That's a modern masterpiece able to switch from comedy to drama to horror without noticing it, all thanks to a great direction and a great editing work."
"Parasite is one of the most perfect movies released in recent years. With its impecable directing and great performances, it delivers a darkly funny, often awkwardly haunting tale that touches on themes of class devide while never forgetting to be first and foremost a very enjoyable thriller."
Tiene una narrativa perfecta y buenos momentos de tensi?n. Es una de las mejores pel?culas de los ?ltimos a?os. ¢®TOTALMENTE RECOMENDADA!
**** movie let's start first you have the most hate able character and then you say rich people are bad but if they were kind then the main character will steal them and kill the innocent father with family with underage guy who **** underage girl old man lies and of e course female character for sexual reason + the movie have sex moment for no reason and it's for you if you do like the movie you will sex movie moment and this movie isn't comedy it's not at all
I watched this film almost a year ago and even today when I remember the scenes I am ecstatic. Parasite is something completely unconventional and this is very good. I went to watch the movie to know nothing history and had a great experience. He's strangely surprising.
"Vou ser honesto, at? a metade do filme estava me divertindo com a tens?o gerada, me parecia uma com?dia estranha mas n?o conseguia parar de ver. Depois que somos apresentados ao personagem que vivia secretamente na mans?o o filme no meu ponto de vista desandou de vez, a fam?lia parasita sofreu muito menos consequ?ncias que a outra que estava sendo sugada(a conclus?o do filme ? seja um parasita, voc? vai sofrer menos que ricos burros?), pra mim quem mais sofreu as consequ?ncias foi o filho de apenas 5 anos que n?o tinha nada a ver com a hist?ria, al?m disso tive a impress?o que muitos momentos s? existiram pra matar tempo, como por exemplo o filho desconfiar, entender o c?digo morse e pra que isso serviu PRA NADA, s? enrolou e fez gerar expectativas. Mais pro final do filme, senti o fator enrola??o de novo com a cena da compra da mans?o e era apenas a imagina??o. O filme ainda quis fazer uma cena bonitinha do filho entendendo o c?digo morse do pai dentro da mans?o, mas a cena foi at? longa, ele teria que estar passando exatamente a mesma mensagem que duraria pelo menos uma hora todos os dias pra talvez um dia algu?m entender e fora o fato que j? n?o tinha a menor empatia com essa fam?lia parasita pra me comover com essa cena bonitinha. Sei l?, vejo esse filme sendo amado pela cr?tica mas eu n?o gostei e o personagem que achei mais legal, no caso o filho de pais ricos teve seu pai morto em sua frente durante seu anivers?rio, fora o fato de que ele j? sofria por ter visto um fantasma que na verdade era outro parasita que morava secretamente em sua casa."
"Just when you think you know where the film is about to go, Bong takes you to a completely unforeseen place! This thriller can never give you any less of what you expect; it is so perfectly directed and shot, so perfectly written and so perfectly played out that, as a critic, you'd be hard pressed to find fault, and as a movie lover, it is just too enthralling for you to look away - or maybe the end would have you out of your seat, bottom line is, you really don't know what to expect! This is so refreshing!"
A marvelous work with the director's brilliant genius and the actors' amazing acting skills
Absolutely stunning from start to finish. It¡¯s even better the second time you watch it...
Way **** first part was ok but it fell apart afterward...trying too be so called overly creative and funny without any direction...trying to hard to fill over two hours of a lackluster screenplay...what a mess.
Probably one of the best movies I have ever watched. It¡¯s a must watch for anyone who likes indie-art movies.
A masterpiece. Moving and funny movie with a lot to say about the class system in modern society.
"Completely unexpected, I went into this movie thinking I was going to hate it but I ended up loving it instead. This film definitely lived up to the hype which is a rarity for me. If you enjoy dark comedies this is one of the best that the genre has to offer."
"Do we all agree that this film receive h*te, because is a foreign film right, I'll never get it, but many countries have to watch film with subtitles, u ain't that special? But talking about the film, is such a masterpiece, from the plot to the final part, everything is so perfect that deserves being called the best film from this decade."
"Me esperaba m?s, despu?s de todo lo que se ha dicho sobre esta **** comedia que intenta meter la diferencia social y de clase y poco m?s."
One of the best movies I've ever seen and I don't like reading subtitles. But it's very well made and I barely noticed I was reading subtitles most of the time. Glad it was not dubbed as I don't think it would have been as captivating. A must watch
No review present. No review present. No review present. No review present.
[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
"Genuinely a master piece, the plot leaves you sitting in a state of utter depression never before has a movie made me laugh, cry, recoil in shock/fear and never felt over the top everything is this movie is believable and grounded in reality, the scenes play out incredibly smooth, the camera work is outstanding,the acting borders on flawless and the music is second to none of you want to experience an entirely different level of movie parasite is the movie for you."
"Although a bit crazy, I still had fun watching ""Parasite"". The movie tackles with a bouquet of emotions that keep you engaged until the end while highlighting social division in the most entertaining way possible."
"The best of the year in every aspect. Editing, story, directing. Social critique and fun."
"gong Joon-Ho¡¯s ultimate genre-defying chef d'©«uvre embodies class warfare and capitalist hysteria. In Bong Joon-Ho¡¯s game-changing social critique, the rich and the wretched descends into capitalist hell in sardonic, comical, and horribly grounded fashion. In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho¡¯s latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d¡¯Or win, ¡°Parasite¡± has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony, but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles. In a way, ¡°Parasite¡± feels like the ¡°Inception¡± of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan¡¯s towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. ¡°Parasite¡±, on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures? it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan¡¯s pic ?comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like ¡°Get Out¡± and ¡°The Invisible Man¡± are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling. Script-wise, ¡°Parasite¡± is an utter knockout. At first glance, the most outstanding, praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists, the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected. These ¡°think-again¡± premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences, even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon-Ho has to offer. The truly one-of-a-kind centerpieces are: proceedings and composition. Take for instance the 5-minute towering montage at the end of the first act, where black humor, cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence. It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up, blurring the line between good and bad, between wealth and the poverty, between sarcasm and irony. Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast, which? by the way ?became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards, making, one more time, movie history. Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Song Kang-ho deliver award-worthy performances, endowing to the story tangible, three-dimensional characters that, in incompetent hands, would come out as hollow caricatures. Bong Joon-Ho¡¯s pictures are described as many things at once: black comedies, social commentaries, genre-crossing post-apocalyptic adventures. Owning every inch of them, ¡°Parasite¡± spices the mix up with deeper, timely metaphors? make no mistake, peaches and basements are not going to be the same; ? however, the film owes it to two crucial aspects: visual language and edition. Camera movements, blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew. It could have been a silent film, and still it would speak volumes. Cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight, grabbing class divide by the throat. What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi-basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion, it is now the perfect visual cocktail: sophistication and softness, luxury and poverty, ups and downs, dark and light, hungry beasts in empty spaces. ¡°Gisaengchung¡± by Bong Joon-Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade. Many critics have healed it as ¡°the picture of the year¡± and, even if it is tout ? fait true, ¡°Parasite¡± transcends the boundaries of society-headed, industry-transforming films; say Jordan Peele¡¯s ambitious allegory ¡°Us¡± reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and Kim Ki-young, and still you are nowhere near to it. Many talented, socially-aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years; now Bong Joon-Ho, in total command of his craft, has made it: ¡°Parasite¡± is a groundbreaking work of art."
Over rated. Thin story. Thin premise. Disagree with the heaps of praise from the critics
"It manages to shift genres effortlessly all while getting across it's large agenda, heavy with symbolism and metaphors throughout critiquing capitalism and overall it's a blast and a thrill ride to watch. Although there is no guarantee this is for you I think it still deserves a watch"
"I can¡¯t get over it, such flawless filmmaking. The suspense killed me. A perfect balance of thrills, humour and complexity."
"I like it very much!Finally,Bong-Joon-Ho was noticed by huge number of **** deserves to be checked.This films is very great,but still not his **** touches serious problems of South Korea and not only Korea.Film attracts watchers by its lightness of watching ,even though,it is very serious work."
"One of the best shot movies I have seen. Story is crazy too! Worth a second watch. Movie has interesting ideas, cant think of any negatives, I would love to see after credit scenes with 1 character (Min)."
I anticipated greatly watching this movie due to its awards and ratings. I am a fan of foreign and quality non hollywood type movies. Much to my surprize i found this movie boring stupid and unwatchable. I had to stop watching it halfway thru.
"I saw Parasite 3 months ago to the date of this review. It's not until now, that I can say this is the best movie I have ever seen. I have thought a long time about what its about and what I saw. It's a movie where when you think you got it all figuered out, the movie just turns at an opposite direction. It's a masterpiece like nothing I've ever seen before. Parasite definitely deserves the Academy Award for best picture, because it is the best picture I have ever seen."
This movie didn't disappoint! Everything felt original and it took a disturbing twist towards the end. The theme of the movie was clear from the get go! Overall great movie and I would watch again!
"¡°You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned. Look around you. Did you think these people made a plan to sleep in the sports hall with you? But here we are now, sleeping together on the floor. So, there's no need for a plan. You can't go wrong with no plans. We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next. Even if the country gets destroyed or sold out, nobody cares. Got it?¡±"
"A totally unexpecting movie! I've never seen such a fresh, startling, overwhelming movie in my whole life. There's absolutely no evils, no angels in this movie. Also, it's no use analyzing it from a political or a social persperctive beacuse that's not what this movie is supposed to say. It's just about a HUMAN BEING itself, and this is what makes PARASITE a brilliant masterpiece and what makes a difference from previous films. Adding a bit of exaggeration, PARASITE is totally a new genre itself. Last but not least, IT'S HUGE FUN!!"
"Amazing. This movie is so many genres at the same time. Drama, thriller, comedy."
A benchmark I will measure future films with. The most epic masterpiece I've ever seen.
"Parasite is an extremely potent movie with an incredible amount to say. Despite having been out for several months, I feel that many of the film¡¯s true intentions won¡¯t be realized for some time. The film is, as it openly admits, ¡°extremely metaphorical¡±, almost every decision feeling well-meant and multi-layered. Many people have stated their interpretations of the work, and I feel most of them are missing the point. Parasite is a satire, yet many people seem to be taking it at face value. In an interview, Bong stated that calling lower-class individuals, people who have no feasible means of class mobility, parasites is missing the point; it is the upper class who saps off the lower class via class warfare and exploitation who are the real parasites. In this way and many more, Parasite likely doesn¡¯t affirm the viewer¡¯s world view, it may seem to do so, but this misconception is illustrative of the divide between reality and perception. Parasite, even if watched as an ideologically vacant film is still incredibly deep, with well-placed reincorporation and a constantly evolving plot. Despite its dark undertones and periodically graphicly violent scenes, Parasite remains to be intensely funny, a humour derived from the absurdist reality of the film¡¯s world and premise."
"Funny, light, thoughtful, deep, suspenseful, dark, all the things Very intelligent film that weaves together many different perspectives and tones masterfully. Several different levels to think about and discuss with others. It will leave you thinking about it for days afterward just to ponder it a bit more. Definitely tell your friends to watch it because you'll want someone to discuss it with. This is a full-course dinner that leaves you perfectly satisfied :)"
"The movie is a brilliant, very dark and edgy comedy, sometimes even a horror movie. The satire and commentary is brilliant and resonates with me so deeply. All the characters and writing is surprisingly realistic and every character has tons of their own put into them. People obviously enjoyed making this movie, and were even very humble about the rewards they deservedly received. I just REALLY REALLY enjoyed this movie, so much that I literally considered (I will get it on VOD as soon as it gets there) buying a second movie ticket because it left such a DAMN impression on me the first time, I was encouraged to see it over other stuff. After seeing the other stuff I still feel I'd have better spent my time seeing the movie again. It's a perfect 10 in every way: production quality, effects, quality of writing (!), the humor, the horror etc.! You MUST see it, at least once or even twice."
"Parasite is about as close to 'perfection' that you can get. The movie successfully blends multiple genres and is a masterpiece of cinematography. The director is constantly and subtly feeding you important information in cool and interesting ways, which makes the eventual twists and turns feel natural and earned. The less you know about this movie before watching; the better. It's easily one of the best films I've ever seen."
"""Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films"" - Bong Joon Ho. Every piece of this genre bending film is meticulously and masterfully crafted. I am absolutely blown away. There's a quality about certain films where, from the first scene, you can tell there's one strong artistic vision behind it. And in film, this is, of course, called direction. The direction behind Parasite is undoubtedly what made it my new favorite film of 2019. Breaking down the qualities of this film in order of appearance, Parasite is shot with real personality. A steady and practiced hand behind the camera adds one extra layer of emotion to every scene, almost treating the frame as if its the vision of an intangible observer. Focus tracks through this film in that manner with absolute precision and in doing so creates an urgency where there otherwise might not have been. The score of Parasite has a John Williams (almost Home Alone) style at its core with layers thrown on top of it to address the actions in each plot point nearly beat for beat. This is more challenging than it sounds due to the winding and weaving plot the film. I won't write much on the plot as it's best experienced with no preconceptions, but I will say that if you're a plot guesser when you watch movies, you are SOL with this one. On top of all of this, the performances rise to the same level of expertise. The actor playing each character undeniably brings their roles' multi-faceted natures to light over the course of the runtime. The script is the foundation for this, but you can really feel the personality of the direction of this film shining through every performance. This is my new favorite film of 2019 and m pick for best picture in a stacked year. Loved this one."
"Overrated. Should not have won the Best Picture Oscar. It¡¯s a fair film but doesn¡¯t stay with you. It doesn¡¯t get into your soul. The twist is good but other than that you are supposed to feel sympathy for the poor over the rich, but you don¡¯t. The rich family are actually nice people and don¡¯t deserve what happens."
"Overrated movie,are the oscars about politics or about movies nowdays,i just don¡¯t know anymore."
It's easy to understand why this movie is considered such a masterpiece. My only complaint would be that I wish it was a little bit scarier. But other than that I found the story to be really compelling and had very complex and numerous themes. The artistry required to discuss these messages and still not beat you over the head with them is just incredible. This is the kind of movie that will stick with you long after you watch it. I know I could spend hours just watching analysis video and interviews with the director. This is definitely a must see.
I can't even describe how well written this movie was. Even in your weirdest Dreams you could never come up with THAT TWIST.
"A fantastic showcase of the power of cinema, in a beautifully shot and edited film that uses these cinematic tools to move forward a gripping plot and a powerful message."
"This movie is just spectacular in every way possible, it's got some great camera work from start to finish. Also, the movie has got some brilliant chemistry with most of the characters in this movie. Finally, I'd say its probably one of the best movies I've ever watched before, I didn't get bored for a second throughout it."
"Yes, Parasite was well crafted and uniquely entertaining; but an **** masterpiece? Come on. It was a comically cliche portrayal of class division served up with a big, heaping scoop of shock-value. I enjoyed the ride, but it¡¯s not the magnum opus it¡¯s billed to be."
"Definitely the best movie I have seen within the entirety of my life. So much in 2 hours, your brain can barely contain it all! Amazing movie!"
"Worth the hype that surrounded it. The contrast, the acting, the absolute top notch screenplay, the twists and the end all are frickin amazing. 9.75 Thought provoking. Will leave you in a contemplative state and that's how powerful this piece of cinema is. Park So-dam is so damn cute."
"Avec un film cor?en, on ne sait jamais ? quoi s'attendre... mais c'est comme ? la bourse, on perd plus souvent qu'on ne gagne... et les chances s'av?rent d'embl?e merdiques surtout ici avec une palme d?cern?e par les peignes-culs de Cannes ? un r?alisateur -qui plus est- tr?s, tr?s in?gal...! Or, la surprise est quasiment totale... car ce n'est pas chiant malgr? tout de m?me deux heures un brin dilu?es parce qu'ici on s'amuse beaucoup et on ricane souvent... le film joue sans cesse des contrastes ?videmment saisissants entre les pauvres tr?s pauvres et les riches tr?s riches, les pauvres qui ""parasitent"" les riches et les riches qui n'en ont mais vraiment, strictement rien ? branler de ces sales pauvres... Tout le film est d'une ironie mordante ? cet ?gard jusqu'au... euh... ""grand final"" singuli?rement exag?r?, puis l'?pilogue... carr?ment d?lirant ! n'oublions pas qu'on est toujours dans un film cor?en et que la demi-mesure l?-bas, on ne conna?t pas... mais c'est aussi pour ?a qu'on les appr?cie, ma foi... Alors bien s?r, on tique quand m?me assez souvent, car le film est en ?quilibre sur une corde raide, celle de la com?die cingl?e et du drame social outr?... mais les com?diens et les com?diennes sont tellement excellents qu'ils arrivent ? faire passer... n'importe quoi, y compris et surtout l'improbable ! Donc en d?finitive, on salue l'audace et la dr?lerie narquoise de l'ensemble...!"
"Movie wasn't that great. Weird bad overacting, overhyped, cheesy and predictable story. Far from a masterpiece. Money buys awards now."
"Absolutely magnificent movie. This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho,"
Yeah this is a good movie. I usually don¡¯t like Korean cinema that much but this one kills it.
I think the best thing I can say about this movie is how well everything blends together. Bong has truly crafted a film that fires on all cylinders and that alone makes me highly recommend watching it.
"Parasite touches on the often big wealth gap in countries, specifically South Korea. I suggest when you watch this you watch with no judgement and have empathy it truly shows a different side of South Korea that I don¡¯t think outside consumers have seen. Not to mention, the filming and angles are great!"
"Bong Joon Ho's one of the best masterpiece of portraying social class division with twisting plots are nothing but incredible. The concept of the movie starts with showing the difference between upper class and lower class people lifestyle and their dependency. It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here. The first half of the film follows the family living at a semi basement apartment in poor locality. After the son is given an opportunity by his friend to teach as a English Tutor in rich family and came to realise that although he is earning more , his family is getting what they deserve. As they are not as bright as the son , so son decides to make a plan to employ their family in that house where he teaches. Sooner they become wealthy as they all working in different positions in the same house. The first half may look flat and give some impression of the base of movie . But when it comes to the second half there is a major plot twisting. It clears the display of showing the struggle of poor within the unjust society and hence this sudden joyful life comes into tragedy. This cast members brilliantly performed their role. The cinematography and background score of make the audience more focused! Its funny , thrilling, emotional and moral based script makes it a masterpiece ! No doubt, it is one of my favourite movie and I am strongly recommend it to watch ( although it is an S.Korean movie )."
Im still just shocked. This 'movie' is actually 2 different movies smoothly put into one. It's nothing but perfect cinema. You can sense the amount of work and genius that has been put in this thing.
"Parasite starts very well and really get's your attention but after the plot starts to ""develop', it goes from amusing to absurd. The ilogical, violent and disapointing ending does not match the clever plot of the beggining. The characters are shallowly presented and inconsistent at times. The sister, Da-hye (jung Ji-so) is the best written and also has the best performance, wich makes her the only character I really cared about. Ki-woo, or Kevin is presented to us as a smart guy at the beginning but suddenly, after the first hour or so, he seens extremely dull. the camera work is great and deserves a mention."
"An extremely surprising movie, impeccably made, with an original story and an unsettling atmosphere."
Very hard film with many different ways of thinking about other peoples in social
"So many moments of nuance, the embedding of the score is so subtle, the editing feels so effortless, and simply one of the best overall ensemble performances I've ever seen. Song Kang-ho and Choi Woo-sik stood out with how their fantastic acting added large depth to their characters, but at the end of the day, Lee Jung-eun stole the show entirely. The production design for me ranks among Anderson's The Grand Budapest hotel, and I believe this film may be as/more influential for everybody to the likes of The Godfather. The cinematography and lighting work feels so sharp, and the storyboards of Bong Jong-Ho are extremely precise. You can feel Bong's direction and the film feels entirely thought out and rehashed multiple times thinking from a filmmaker's perspective. The screenplay aaaaa. I can't praise this film enough. This film is too close to being ""perfect"", my only issue is that the third act, while it wraps up the film thematically and is one that has grown on me, feels a teensy tiny bit out of place. 97/100"
"Parasite Movie Review: 10/10 Simply an amazing, breathtaking movie that deserves the Oscar for its original script, great actors and an incredible, creative storyline with many metaphors and attention to detail."
"Groundbreaking and genre-defying, Parasite is undoubtedly a integral landmark in cinema history."
"Honestly, this movie is an argument for why people shouldn¡¯t ignore foreign films. The story of class struggle and the difference between the rich and poor is timeless and very universal, the characters all feel like real people, and the movie is good at keeping up the suspense and drama without being melodramatic. Do make sure that if you watch this with subtitles that they are good subtitles that are large and are a colour that won¡¯t blend in with backgrounds - I watch this as a PPV and the subtitles were these tiny white ones that disappeared into light coloured dogs, floors, and walls and this is a movie where you need to know what characters are saying."
"Vamos a ver, sinceramente no me pareci? para tanto en su momento, pero s?, es una buena pel?cula, eso no se lo puede quitar nadie."
What a great film! parasite is for sure one of the best movies i have ever seen! this movie had a fantastic/original story and an ending that i didn't see coming ! my score 100%
"Just incredible. I just couldn't keep myself calm because the movie just keep you awake and trapped. I absolutely loved it, a great film full of plot twists, comedy, entertainment, etc. It has everything, and it's definitely worth watching."
"I saw bong joon-ho's the host and I can see he brings many of the same themes (poverty, classism, codependent family relationships) in his latest movie parasite. What starts as an endearing tale of a crooked family drama (which gets a bit long in the tooth) takes a hard right into 'lets see how long they can play hide and seek in the house' all the way to 'metaphorical homeless guy lives in the basement and worships the upperclass homeowner'.... So not very subtle writing here! Still the cast are superb here and the cinematography was slightly above average. My only wish is that the screenplay held back from it's flights of fancy long enough for us to enjoy the wonderful texture of that first 30 mins. A decent watch overall."
WorthWatch Movie . Full of Drama And Thrill . Message of discrimination Is properly Displayed
"I have never cared about acollades. I never watch a film because it has won a Golden Globe or listen to a specific album because it has won 3 Grammys. But this time it has been different. When I saw the huge amount of Academy Awards ""Parasite"" was recieving, I felt the immediate need to see it. And I won't ever regret it. ""Parasite"", directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a perfect mix of black comedy, thriller, drama and social critic. It just has everything. The title is also magnificent. It makes you think that you'll see South Korea battling against ""coronavirus"" but no; you'll watch a capturing movie where the word ""parasite"" will recieve another deep meaning: the way poor people are seen by the rich class and how someone opposed to you is a kind of virus inside your house; something that doesn't fit in, that does not belong here nor isn't welcomed. This film is, by far, a must-see for cinema lovers since it has all factors that make a movie perfect. My congartulations to the actors and director who made me cry of joy and of sadness and have made me see how this world is a beautiful mess."
Parasite is the epitome of perfect use of visual language. The reason this film translates so well to American audiences is because of its symbols and cinematography. All of which is due to the brilliant directing.
"Full of hilarious and tragic surprises. Wildly entertaining. Though provoking. Gorgeously filmed, masterfully written, superbly acted. Deserved to win the oscar!"
"I was very surprised that this film won the Oscar for Best Film. Its not a great film, just a good one. It started interestingly enough, but moved from amusing and potentially thought-provoking, to melodramatic and violent. I thought it was all quite pointless in the end. Forgettable, and possibly the worst Oscar selection ever. Crash was a better, more memorable movie that was similarly overrated and won Best Pic. There were numerous better films made in 2019, Joker, 1917, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, First Man....Even whatever Marvel movie came out this year was likely more interesting and memorable. This is not the years best picture, at all, it most likely won the award because the director is ""Diverse"", much like the sycophancy surrounding Black Panther. The hype is similarly political. This movie is not required watching for any reason. The star of the movie is ruthless Korean housecleaning."
"I'm a huge fan of Joon-ho Bong's works. The Host and Mother are two of my all time favorite films. Not even joking. Mother made me cry more than any movie ever has. That said, this movie ****. Beautifully shot but terrible pacing, acting, scripting, and really seems to care more about shoving class differences down your throat and focusing on shock value over actual storytelling."
"Parasite is the best movie of 2019, it is a great black comedy and a social satire. This is a masterpiece from the master film-maker Bong Joon-Ho and the best to see in the world of cinema. It's violent but also gives out positive messages (15+), and also it has won many awards so far such as BEST PICTURE and BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY so I say it's a must to see and it's very great."
"tudo nesse filme ? perfeito... a fotografia, a edi??o, a atua??o, a dire??o... assistir Parasita incomoda, principalmente ?queles que n?o entendem sua principal mensagem. J? assisti 2 vezes e assistiria mais"
"Parasite is a genre bending film that will stand the test of time. Director Bong Joon Ho has showed that he has mastered his craft as a director and a screenwriter. The theme of class division is consistent throughout the movie and is shown beautifully through visual storytelling, dialogue, and symbolism. The film's social commentary on the two way parasitic relationship between the rich and the poor in today's society is displayed in a very entertaining and creative way. The twists and surprises along with the super intriguing concept of this con-story made for a movie that entertains as much as any film ever made. Narratively speaking, this story is one for the ages, but it doesn't just stop there. Parasite is a beautiful film thanks to its beautiful and purposeful cinematography, and due to its well-thought out production design. Not only is Parasite a beautiful film to visually take in, but every visual aspect of this film is installed for a reason. Most of the time the visual aspects are installed to enhance the theme of class division. The editing of this film took Parasite to levels even further than already discussed. The flawless editing helped the pace of the movie feel flawless, and it enhanced the thrilling vibe that this movie gives off. The actors in this film ground this realistic yet crazy concept of a film in reality. Without their terrific chemistry and performances, I am not sure that the film would've resonated with as many people as it did. Parasite is a beautiful ride of a movie that transcends any other film experience I've ever encountered. Parasite has invented a new genre of film that just doesn't have a name yet. It's message on how there is a parasitic relationship across classes has been relevant for centuries and will always be relevant. Because of this, the pure thrill of entertainment the movie provides, and the technical craftmanship of this film, I believe Parasite will become a film that will be recognized worldwide as one of the greatest achievements in cinema. Parasite is not only my favorite film of 2019, but it may perhaps be my favorite film of all-time."

"You know how you read reviews and go into a movie with high expectations. That's what happened to me, seeing all the good review, I had over hyped hopes for this movie. I'm not gonna say they didn't live up to those expectations but.. It wasn't what I was expecting. The story is a bit all over the place and far fetched but hey that's what I'm used to in Asian horror. I'm going to say that this is a must for any asian thriller fans. The again, I don't even think it's considered a horror. Just has some creepy elements to it. I'd say with the story alone it gets a 7.. With the gorgeous cinematography, that bumps it up to an 8. Some really awesome shots from a photographer's perspective. Loved the telephone wire scene. After saying all that, don't take my word for it, actually don't read reviews at all, they can only tarnish the viewing experience. Heck one of my favorite movies is rated a 30% on rotten tomatoes, that goes to show you how much salt should be taken with a review."
"Now it's the time to stop that longing, Parasite was just flashed me through my mind and filled that completion of my waiting. Since it was released, it was talked, it was going for awards and it created a history in Academy Awards I was so far and keen to watch this movie and it veils the curtain now. As a movie, it is worth watching because I'm not used to the socio-political aspects of Korean culture. The film describes the class variations and social norm dividing people into rich and poor. But actually what makes me attractive is that kind comic blending at the beginning by the family to enter into the Park mansion. Going smoothly, sometimes it provides a little bit tense and frights the film has a steady graph till the end and then it hype accidentally and I feel astonished. The mood of the movie changed vice-versa and it shook me for some time. A very changing pattern of Korean society and Korean classification was the major essence that I can find in the movie."
"Masterpiece is putting it lightly. This is the best movie of the last 10 years, if not the last 20. We're all parasites."
Your Review Must Be At Least #075 Characters Long. Review: A Mixed Feeling.
"I think a ten film is one that you enjoy in the moment, but it stays with you after. I¡¯ll be thinking about this movie for days and will continue to get more out of it as I do so. I thought I would be let down after all they hype and this is not the case. My only complaint is that it does feel a little long at points, although I don¡¯t know what they could have cut."
"Solid 10. During the entire movie you will be anxious to find out what happens next. It has a lot if symbolism regarding the movie¡¯s main theme. For a movie that is meant to be so dark, it is quite humorous at times, it¡¯s part of what makes the movie so great. Those who rated this movie with a bad score or didn¡¯t like it should just stick to watching the pile of trash being pushed out by Marvel (like Deadpool). If you¡¯re into that kind of garbage, this is probably not the movie for you."
"A must see? Nah. Interesting, unpredictable, funny, dark, original, tense, and even Shakespearean, so it's good. Bit I think this is the dori of movie that people ""want"" to line. Cinematically I don't know how Mendes was passed up for Best Director...I don't set what justifies that. And Bessy Picture? I reserve that for the kind of movies are worth repeating. Without the element of surprise I don't see the need here. Watch it. But a must see? Only if you see Old Boy first. THAT is a must see."
"I don't know what to say about this film apart from how this film is masterful film making. I don't even want to give a synopsis for this film as this film is best experienced with no knowledge whatsoever. The plot is amazing and extremely gripping with every twist and turn. Likewise, the way it tackles the social themes is so intriguing and done so extremely well even if the theme has been done many times before. The entire cast is amazing and honestly not even one of them getting a nomination for best acting is quite the robbery. Huge praise to Song Kang-ho and Park So-dam especially, they gave amazing performances. The cinematography/set design is also impressive and uniquely correlates with the ongoing story. The use of staircase and lines to tackle the ongoing theme, while not subtle, is done extremely well. The soundtrack, while not exactly memorable, manages to elevate the tense atmosphere and keep people on the edge of their seats. Finally, the film is absolutely entertaining with the way it incorporates contrasting genres, black comedy and thriller, into one surprisingly cohesive and exhilarating movie. THIS IS A MUST WATCH! It deserves best picture for a reason."
This is fantastic and it will never bore you Awesome movie.. you must watch
"Parasite is hard to qualify. The story is related to class of citizens. The movie is kind of dark funny and somewhat insidious. I felt it was too slow in the middle. The actors are excellent. The photography and filming is well done, with a lot of nice angles. I give it 85%. This is a movie that can be in the corner of your mind for a while."
The best script meets the best director with the best cast and an amazing crew. The culmination of such talent results in an amazing movie. A true art form. A genre of its own. PARASITE never fails and flaunts its knives out. The approach is insane with the ever sought plot twists and narratives true to life. The film perfect for all.
"It is the best film I have ever seen, because it works with the raw truth, a true teaching for human beings to have more compassion for others and that greed does not get anyone anywhere"
Absolutely mind-blowing. Expect the unexpected. The film is thoroughly enjoyable and equally thought provoking
"An uncategorisable masterpiece What is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define Parasite? Part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. What is certain is that it's exceptional in just about every way ? screenplay (co-written by director Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, mise en sc?ne, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things ? it lives up to the hype. The Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment eking out a meagre living folding pizza boxes. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo bluffs his way into working as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park family. Father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) welcome Ki-woo into their home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as Parasite is, it remains an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. This is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, but never before has he been this caustic and acerbic, but so too compassionate and witty. One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is his avoidance of the clich?s one so often finds in films dealing with economics ? the Kims are by no means a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Bong is uninterested in trucking in heroes and villains because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, whilst the Parks' greatest crime is allowing their wealth to insulate them from the world of families such as the Kims. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims often occupy the same frame, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot. Important here is the title. A simple reading is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, Bong depicts the Parks as parasitic as well, feeding off of the labour of their servants. Just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what is a symbiotic relationship. Aesthetically, Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography is magnificent. Hong also shot the superb Beoning (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks' house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' cluttered and dilapidated apartment contrasted with the Parks' pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house. It's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found. As a story at least partly in the tradition of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" subgenre, Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below by using stairways as a recurring motif. The Kims' apartment has no stairs, indicating their inability to rise socio-economically. On the other hand, the Parks' home has two stairways ? one going up to the bedrooms where the four children spend an increasing amount of time, cut off from their parents, and one going down into the cellar. Bong shoots this stairway like he's suddenly directing a horror film, bestowing upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. Parasite is a masterpiece, with Bong never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie ? a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich ? but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy and so on. This is cinema as art, a film which has proven itself very much a game-changer and completely deserving of every bit of praise it's received."
Speechless! Extravaganza...words are worthless to define such Great piece of cinema! Right from the start we were too much into the story that I was shocked the movie is over like 15 mins only!such smooth screenplay with simple but effective score with an hinge of doubts it was sure a classic cinema!
It is an art and full of mysteries that will always keep you busy wondering what will happen next. No cliches or any nonsense. Straight story telling and great acting. The Director is really good.
"Definitely deserved Best Picture award. The movie features incredible cast and screenplay. It has delivered in almost all fields of filmmaking. However, even that i understood the film's message, i feel the plot could have been done even better. I had higher expectations from it. Watch it anyway! :)"
An amazing suspense thrilling dark comedy that left me in awe at the end. This film will stay with long after viewing.
A masterpiece that¡¯s even better on second viewing. The score and editing in this movie is underrated and needs more recognition.
Brilliantly depicts the class division in today¡¯s society and how we subconsciously view others based on monetary worth.
"Parasite is the most overrated Oscar winner of all time and apparently nobody is allowed to discuss the flaws, plot holes, and very problematic subtext without being harassed. I am Asian. I will discuss this more later. Least deserving BP winner ever."
"An incredible story of a poor family who scams their way into working for a rich family, each taking on a separate role. The movie moves forward and becomes more intense as each moment occurs, culminating in a finish that is thrilling. A fantastic movie that feels fresh and full of new thoughts and ideas even 2 hours in."
"What a waste of time. Can't see what everyone is going on about. The synopsis is very vague and so is the film, as nothing happens and everything is blown out of proportion and nothing is explained or makes any sense."
"oh, wow. ."
"Parasite really holds its value. Its interesting how all the negative reviews are butt hurt comments with zero constructive analysis or argument. Overall, I enjoyed every bit of the movie. Its mind-blowing how the movie captures the differences in class by the angle switching and the rhythm of the music. crazy!"
"certainly, the best foreign film and I have no problem with the palm de or , but best director, original screenplay, and best picture? I don't get it."
"The hype behind this move is deserved. Went into see it thinking it was likely just another overrated movie but delighted to be proven completely wrong. It's best to go in and see it not knowing anything about it and to just enjoy the ride. A fantastic movie with a brilliant screenplay, shot composition and a cast that nail their characters so well that despite the move being subbed, every emotion and story turn is easily understood and beautifully delivered. One of the best movies I have seen in many a year. You won't stop talking about it afterwards!"
"Don¡¯t like captioned movies BUT Parasite was wonderful,funny,silly, and very entertaining! Recommend it very highly and see why it won so many awards!!"
Bong Joon-ho continues to establish himself as one of the most original working directors with this multi-layered dark comedy
"It deserved the oscar wins, it's a fantastic movie, it's deep but also entertaining"
"Absolute masterpiece, worth anybodies time. I see a small amount of people complaining about violence or sexual content, but to really have a good look at society you cannot shy away from the more gruesome sides of people."
"Amazing! A film full of metaphors, social criticism, minute details, a direction that takes control of the entire film from beginning to end. A film that is worth seeing again, again, and again, you notice details that the first time I didn't notice for lack of information, but that now make sense and give even more richness to this work. Simply fascinating!"
"A timeless Masterpiece, a review wouldn¡¯t do this film proper justice, just go watch it. Well deserving of its four oscars in Best Picture, Directing, International Feature Film and Writing (Original Screenplay). Still i am a bit dissapointed that non of the cast was even nominated for acting. All around gripping and mesmerizing preformances & plot."
"I saw this movie for the third time now. I'm still trying to think of a movie that's better than this one and coming up short. The first ever non-English spoken movie that won the best movie oscar, simply because it was the best movie. It's an amazing story with a twist and an ending that I really didn't see coming. A drama/comedy balance with social commentary that works surprisingly well. The acting is simply great and I think it'll be a while before something better comes to the big screen. It's just really, really good, even after seeing it three times I still love every second of it."
"Boring Worst movie I have seen all year, people who said good reviews need to wake up"
"The film is very good but not a masterpiece. It says a lot about the state of art now if a film with so many flows is considered genius. It is not. Actors are excellent but actors are excellent everywhere now days. The script is a problem, as it is the problem in 99% of films. The film begins very well, picks up speed but then loses momentum. The flood spoils it especially. It was not needed to convey the message, it was too much, too obvious, too in your face. But still, it is a courageous film, which dared to address the problem rarely addressed. It has no real love story, thanks God. Overall, it is great just falls short of a masterpiece some critics claim it to be. it is also very funny at times and definitely universal."
"The somewhat rare genre bender that works, it is clever and unpredictable up to a point, masterfully crafted, and an overt social commentary on class. It is not this masterpiece classic to be the jackass critics and sheep Academy sing the overpraises of. The casual cursing by a family to each other throughout is oh so typical liberal depravity that artists think is fine but it's not. It debases the culture however subtly over time. The big take away of this film is affirmation there's a reason these crazy goofs can never be allowed to get a nuclear weapon."
"For me it always come down to one big thing that dictates whether a movie is ""good"" or ""great"" and that's the moment you look back and realize whether or not you've been thinking about that same movie days after you've watched it or not. Parasite is a movie you will think about for days afterwards. I don't really want to say anything else considering this movie is best viewed blind. But you need to see it."
"This movie is absolutely amazing, one of the best movies I¡¯ve seen in my life. It literally shocked me!"
"The perfect example of contemporary art. Easily digestible for the masses, as it's a very entertaining film, but also extremely important and complex for those who seek more than just a way to spend 2 hours of their lives. And that creates the confusion of ""good, but overrated"", because this film is art disguised in common clothes.Therefore it became mainstream, and a lot more people that look for fast-food cinema ended up watching it. So obviously they cannot understand where the 10/10 and the 100% are coming from. Their confusion is justified. But just because you are not qualified enough to get it, doesn't mean it's trash or ""overrated"". Even though I adore this film, I only suggest it ti people that I know can and will appreciate it. It's a shame to watch this film through the eyes of a Marvel/DC-fanboy. So if you're not into this kind of cinema, better stay away. Don't jump into the train just because it's ""in"" atm. However, if you like an extremely funny, impeccably made and thought provoking film, that will stay with you for days after you watched it, and you are ready to actually concentrate and pay attention to details, then what the **** are you doing? Go watch it right now!"

"A disappointing (shocking, absurd, illogical) ending to a classic yet beautifully constructed plot. For me, this is ¡°the movie that could have been¡±. Or ¡°the glass half full¡±. At half point, the story gets so complicated that there is no way of redressing it. Pity."
This suspense thriller is articulated with so much control that it keeps any viewer invested for more.
This movie is unique i would like to see more about these type of movies 10 of 10
This movie covers all the film genres as well as all the themes of our lives it is truly amazing although I could see it going over the heads of closed minded people.
"La pel?cula logra construir a sus personajes de forma perfecta, casa uno tiene un prop?sito una motivaci?n y una personalidad ?nica, el director consigue hacer una cruda representaci?n de las diferencias sociales en el mundo, aunque sea una pel?cula koreana est? pel?cula habla un idioma universal"
"Filme muito bom, ganhou o oscar n?o foi por acaso, com personagens muito bem desenvolvidos e com uma historia muito bem escrita com diversas met?foras e reviravoltas no ponto certo, acredito que os pontos positivos qualquer um consegue achar em tudo, mas falar dos pontos negativos ? um pouco mais dif?cil, na minha concep??o pelo fato de ser um filme coreano e n?o estarmos tao familiarizados com a interpreta??o deles, em muitos momentos parecia muito for?ado algumas interpreta??es de forma que o filme parecesse muito mais c?mico do que deveria, isso pelo fato das mensagem do filme ser clara (apesar de muitos culparem um lado ou outro, ideia errado ja que ambos os lados s?o culpados por suas atitudes), outro ponto negativo ao meu ver ? o final que se estendeu de uma forma desnecess?ria ao ponto de deixar as coisas ainda mais confusas, e por fim outro ponto negativo e talvez o mais importante foi que na primeira metade do filme tudo pareceu muito previs?vel, todavia vale ressaltar que a segunda metade tomou um caminho completamente diferente causando a todo minuto duvidas do que aconteceria em seguida"
"As one other reviewer said, all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie. TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done jsutice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troup?. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind, I don't think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it. Beware though, last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory."
"It didn't do anything for me. I didn't find it compelling, funny, didn't like any of the characters. I heard all this hype about the movie - not my cup of tea l."
"Parasite is soo engaging during every minute of watching it I was waiting for the next minute to come that how excited this movie got me, it's a true masterpiece that will live on for ages and truly oscar worthy"
"Best in 2019, i don't thought korean movies could impress me so much, ending is awesome"
"Just brilliant. A look at the consequences of capitalism. The script is very well done and it is very difficult to understand where the film is going, which puzzles you all the time."
Eu amei tanto esse filme...................................................
"Beautifully crafted movie. Bong Joon-ho has come a long way to the top, and apparently he mastered all the skills required for making a great movie. Can't wait to see his next movie. Oh, and if you haven't seen his earlier works (""Mother"", ""Memories of Murder"") - go check them out immediately."
"An unpredictable film full of intrigue and plot twists, you have to watch it without knowing anything about it, which will make you enjoy much better"
I don¡¯t understand this movie at all. Pardon me If I¡¯m not a millennial. But movies that revolve around politics really bore me.
A Feast for the eye and ear. This 4 Oscar winning film is compelling and ingenious. Do not be put off by the subtitles as this is both quality film making and also accessible to a mainstream audience. The less you know about the story the more enjoyment you will get from the movie. Just be assured this is a real treat!
En ba?ta film nas©¥l ilerleyecek diye s©¥k©¥ld©¥m.Fakat izledik?e ilgin? olmaya ba?lad©¥.?ok farkl©¥ enteresan ve g?zel bir kurgusu var. Beklenmedik bi ba?yap©¥t izledim.10/10
? bom demais! chega ser um hino de t?o bom! assista. vale a pena! Eu adorei
"La pel?cula es buena, pero el final tira por la borda todo lo que forma durante al inicio. Lamentablemente no se puede juzgar una pel?cula solo por el comienzo sino que el desenlace es casi tan importante como el inicio, es justamente el final el que no demuestra estar a la altura del resto del film."
"I had this in my queue to watch for a couple weeks now, but the recent Oscar win forced my hand. I can definitely see why critics and voters liked this film, and I don't think there will be much dissent from the common viewer. It is certainly the best I saw in 2019."
"Parasite is a richly creative & wonderful dark dramedy that reaffirms your faith that if you just give movies a chance, they might just blow you away. This is a story about class differences on many levels- not just money- and the people trying to cope and coexist. The beauty here is the viewer is hit with all sorts of surprises and twists. One never knows what is just around the next corner. Parasite is so unique and clever in a time that creativity is in rare supply. I don't usually ever give A+ marks to movies, but this one earns it. It is definitely worthy of its Best Picture Oscar and one not to be missed."
"Gratuitous sex, totally unnecessary to the plot...excessive violence, again not really necessary to the plot. The story was interesting but not compelling. Cannot live up to high expectations for an oscar-winning best film."
La primera pel?cula asi?tica nominada al Oscar y con justa y merecida razon
"Parasite was a brilliant movie with incredible characters who develop throughout the whole story. The theme of class struggle was exhibited extremely well. The lower class people were placed physically lower than the richer people. The basement of the rich home also houses a poor Man who is separated from them by multiple flights of stairs. The poor people¡¯s homes are flooded by the literal waste of the rich homes. As the Ki family physically gets higher and higher, their social status does too. The higher they go the more their personalities change also. They end up fighting a family who is in a very similar situation to them. The members of the Ki family have changed their personalities so much they now act like they are rich and threaten to call the police on them. The film tries to show how wealth changes people and does it very well. Just like the title implies, having wealth is like a parasite that grows and grows once it gets it grip on someone. The Ki family his ok with pushing other families down as long as it means they stay comfortable in their newly gained wealth. The film also does a great job of illustrating how the rage in Mr. Kim grows throughout the film. The rich family says they hate the smell of him and essentially poor people as a whole. They say they smell like the subway. Then as Mr. Kim returns to work after having his home flooded by the rainfall, the rich mother says that the rain was a blessing and that it made for such a great day. Then Mr. Park reminds Mr. Kim that he is being paid and is an employee not a friend. The final straw comes when Mr. Park holds his nose when he gets near Mr. Kim while trying to retrieve his keys. Mr. Kim then stabs him in anger. This is a representation of how rich people treat poor people with so much disdain and poor people one day won¡¯t be able to take it any more. The cinematography was really good as well. There were so many small details that made the movie great. One great example of this was when the homes were flooding, the lights blinked SOS in Morse code."
"El gui?n es impresionante, como puede generar entramados de historias, tantos c?rculos conectados. desde la familia por un lado, desde la ciudad por otro. desde el hogar, desde la calle. desde el suelo, desde la tierra. desde los par?sitos y los parasitados. hay muchos binomios"
Disappointingly overrated - the screenplay and directing was frequently painfully heavy-handed and awkwardly overzealous in its attempts to be a meaningful and important film about class. Reading though Korean explanations about the attempts at symbolism in the film that non-Koreans would miss reinforced this conclusion. But the film is worth watching for some well-acted scenes depicting different levels of Korean life which were enjoyable.
"It¡¯s rare for a foreign film to gain as much popularity with American audiences as the South Korean film Parasite has done. It¡¯s even rarer for a foreign film to earn Academy Awards nominations for Best Foreign Language (now called International) film and Best Picture, but Parasite has managed to join this exclusive club. Director Bong Joon-ho has long been turning out top quality, intriguing work (I¡¯m a big fan of his melancholy 2003 film Memories of Murder, about a years long hunt for a serial killer). Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won¡¯s Oscar nominated original screenplay switches tones and even genres so abruptly and successfully, it makes Parasite a unique movie to say the least. Combined with a stellar cast, excellent cinematography, production design, and pacing, Parasite becomes a thoroughly engrossing, extraordinary experience. Movies like this in any language are rare indeed. Parasite begins as a dark comedy and sharp satire about economic inequality and class disparity. The Kim family lives in a shabby basement apartment. The street level window provides them a view of ankles and urinating drunks. They work short term odd jobs and hunt around their apartment for a spot with Wi-Fi. A change in luck comes when a friend of their teenage son recommends him as a tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks. The son, Ki-woo, reluctantly accepts though he is under qualified. Soon the Kim family schemes to replace each of the Park family servants with themselves though they pose under false identities. The 20-ish Kim daughter, Ki-jeong, provides the family with false credentials. Things take a fateful and irreversible turn when the Kims decide to have a night in luxury while the Parks are away for the weekend. That plot description seems to make the title describe the Kim family. As you watch them work their way into the home of the Park family, you may find the title applies more to the Parks whose lifestyle requires people like the Kims. The differences between a family that is oblivious of their wealth and a family that schemes to get stable, working-class jobs is apparent. But then, the film reveals layers and depth that make it truly profound. When the film becomes a riveting thriller, it does not eschew its themes and substance. I cannot recall the last time I had no idea where a film was going, not because of incompetence, but because I was watching the work of a master filmmaker. The entire ensemble is terrific. Each role is well cast and there¡¯s a great chemistry between the members of the respective families. The stand outs for me, however are Song Kang-ho as the Kim family patriarch and Park So-dam as his clever daughter. Cho Yeo-jeong as the daffy and gullible Park matriarch is great comic relief. What sets Parasite a step above other socially conscious films is it does not sacrifice entertainment for the sake its social commentary or vice versa. It never pontificates or pretends to have any didactic solution. It is like a classic Twilight Zone episode, up front about its themes but in such a way that doesn¡¯t speak down to audience and feels detached and immediate simultaneously. There is not a single pandering moment in the entire film. Parasite uses the real problems and concerns of modern society to tell a compelling and universal story that causes us to reflect on our world. That can be the definition a great film and great art."
"Not at all impressed. Whether sad or uplifting, or both, I want to leave the theatre with a new perspective on life. Parasite left me flat, in spite of trying too hard to capture me. I was hoping we would be blessed with 2 consecutive Oscar winners - Green Book and 1917- made to simultaneously entertain and enlighten audiences. Now I fear that the artsy crowd has its ""The Artist"", ""Birdman"", and ""No Country for Old Men"", unwatchable trash that won't rate higher than a test pattern on overnight TV. If Parasite wins Best Picture, might as well put sticks of bubble gum in next year's envelopes."
"Parasite, Bong Joon-Ho's recent Satire of the social class division in South Korea is nothing short of incredible. The film is more or less divided into two major sections: the first half of the film follows a Family living in the poor areas of Seoul (im assuming). After the son Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik)is given the opportunity to work as an English tutor in an extremely rich household, he begins to realize that despite having a great income, the adults of the family are not exactly the brightest of induviduals, and so slowly Ki-Woo and his family devise a plan to all come into the employment of their new wealthy acquaintances. Although the film may give a lighthearted impression, once the movie transitions into the second half it becomes extraordinarily twisted, slightly resembling the ending of Robert Eggers's 'The Lighthouse'. After contemplating the events that took place witin the film, It seems obvious to me that Like JB Priestley's 'An Inspector Calls', Bong Joon-ho intends for this movie to display a clear contast between the lives of the rich and the struggles of the poor within this obviously unjust society. Of course it doesn't just rub your face with morals, and there is a very substantial and entertaining plot, but this is one of the main focuses of the movie. As for the other, i'd say that would be the excellent dynamic between characters which is further developed by the brilliant performances from every cast member, particularly Park So-dam who in my opinion was robbed of a Best supporting actress nomination. Other notable features include some top of the line cinematography and a outstanding writing, but other than that I feel there isn't much to talk about. Parasite is an absolute masterpiece, and like so many other films that have come out recently I absolutely recommend it. Fun fact: Elon Musk officially stated that Parasite was his favorite movie of 2019, and whie that's all well and good, the film practically exists to ridicule people like him."
Funny premise that goes places but completely over-hyped. Can't help but feel that people are celebrating the message rather than the movie which is disturbing.
"I'm going to refer to this as ""The Movie"" from now on until I find something fully encapsulates what cinema can achieve in a better fashion. We certainly haven't seen something that could surpass this in the decade before it was released. This was simply perfection."
"I felt so many emotions watching Parasite and I'm dying to see it again. There is a reason you've heard so much about this film. Yes, it's true some movies that receive a lot of hype end up not quite living up to it but in this case do not be afraid to believe the hype. It's an original story with superb acting. I've never seen anything like it, one of the best films I've seen in years. Film fans this is not to be missed its phenomenal and will stay with you long after it has ended. An unemployed family (the Kims) take a very keen interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks family, quickly integrating themselves into their lives despite the stark contrast in social status. That's all I'm going to say about the plot because the less you know about Parasite the better. It's incredibly unexpected and does not play out the way you think it would at all. It gives you moments of extreme awkwardness and hilarity. There are times where you have to laugh just to release the ever building tension. It's a comedy, drama and horror all rolled into one masterful movie. Bleak, violent, a dark and twisted story that will constantly keep you guessing. Director and writer Bong Joon Ho has truly outdone himself with this masterpiece. Parasite is one of those rare films you can't stop thinking about after you leave the cinema. It's so profoundly disturbing and bizarre I'm still trying to process it. I understand not everyone takes the time to see subtitled films and to them I can only say you honestly don't know what you're missing. Foreign language films have the extra edge to them, and if you don't believe me then just take the time to see The Host, The Raid or Pan's Labyrinth. Very few foreign language films have the potential to finally break the record by winning a Best Picture Oscar but if anything can do it Parasite can. Unpredictable and highly provocative, I cannot recommend this highly enough. If you only see one film this year let it be Parasite. What else do I need to say? Are you still reading this? Well stop, get yourself to a cinema and see it, you won't be sorry."

"The film made me feel different things while watching it, like anguish, anger, fear and even joy. It is amazing how the film can change so much from beginning to end without realizing it, and when we notice it, we are already very euphoric waiting for future events. The film is full of super well done scenes. It is usually a discreet angle of the camera that gives us the view of grandeur or claustrophobia. The perfect montage along with the soundtrack, which causes us a lot of anxiety and magnifies the main characters' wooden face, or a big turnaround in the script, containing once again, a montage, soundtrack and performances collaborating so that the scene is quite harmonious . I never thought I'd be in any doubt if I hoped someone would do well or badly in the story. I loved the experience, I loved the film and the social criticism it proposes about class difference, showing in a very discreet way the privileges of some and the lack of privileges of others. Parasite (Gisaengchung), for sure, is one of the best films I've ever seen."
"One of the best 2019 films.This is a really great film with interesting plot and great actors` perfomances .In my opinon,everybody has to see this masterpiece by genius from Korea."
"Simply OVERRATED, first hour it's ok, but the second it's repetitive and boring"
There we things that I liked about the movie and things I didn't. It was interesting and the actors were very good. The choreography was very good as well. But the story was slow and drawn out. I wish there pace was faster and more urgent.
perfect and heartbreaking. i just love it. its so professional and well done
"'parasite' A parasite is a living organism that receives nutrients from the host body And parasites are not good for the host body What if two parasite organisms come together in one host body? .this is what the 'Bong joon Ho' put forward to us .the main theme of film is Characteristics of Human Beings Changing their circumstances. Reality is that after all, more than half the species on Earth are parasites, and most organisms are host to a number of them. kim ki- taek is a poor man who lives in a basement home with 4 of his family **** only family income is Proceeds from pizza cover **** evening at dinner, a friend of Kim Ki-woo's (Kim Ki-woo is Ki Taek's son) came to visit ki-woo and he gifted his grandfather's a collection stone to them and forward a job opportunity to ki-woo. Ki-woo makes a fake certificate and looks forward to that job, and then he starts teaching Mr. and Mrs. Park's daughter in their home permanently. da hye fall in love with ki -woo Mrs. Park's son da - song He is a child of disobedience but he is highly talented of drawing Ki-woo sees this as an opportunity and recommends his own sister as a drawing teacher and an art therapist, But really, she¡¯s not one of these and she also enters the house. Kim ki - taek tells his family ""rich people are realy gullible"" The two Kims plan to dismantle Mr. Park's driver and appoint their father as the driver, and then the entire Kim family together plan to disband the hose keeper. Kim's wife comes to the house of the park's housekeeper, and they all continue to work It is here that the name of the film becomes a make sense   Kim's family life goes well in that house. One day Mr. Park's family goes on a camping trip because tomorrow is his son's birthday Kim's family gathers at Mr. Park's house that night, unbeknownst to Park Suddenly, the former house keeper gets there and changes the story of the entire course That night, everyone in the house changes their lives. If I say anything more about this movie, it will affect the enjoyment of the film. Bong joon ho was able to make the screenplay of the film nuancly crafted Everything that comes out of this movie is interconnected, even a stone. Kang ho song's performance as ki - taek is **** acting of kang's physically and mentally embracing the mannerism of the character is commendable. The storyline, which goes on as usual, is as terrifying as it gets near the end of the story. The director was able to intensify all the situations in the film, and he is worthy of applause. (example :Ki - taek tells to Mrs. park that your house keeper has TB. the housekeeper takes a coughing when Ki - taek and Mrs.park steps up the stairs then the camera focus toward Mrs.park's face The director edits those scenes into Slowmotion)"
"I¡¯ve been waiting for the hype train to slow down to watch this movie so I could try to go into it without any expectations. I will say everything I¡¯ve heard and read has been very positive about the experience of watching it from friends, users and critics alike. I¡¯ve seen all of Joon-Ho Bong¡¯s films and while I¡¯ve never out right hated any of them, I¡¯ve never thought that they were for me. They tend to be unpleasant and have an obsession with being locked away both physically and emotionally from the outside world. This movie is probably the one I¡¯ve liked the least on first viewing. I didn¡¯t feel like any character was particularly clever and no one had any redeeming qualities. In the end I just didn¡¯t care what happened to anyone in the movie. While that seems to be what Bong is trying to incite, the main thrust of the movie was just too boring and left me unimpressed."
I have heard film critics rave about this movie since the Cannes movie festival in May of 2019.I have to say I was quite disappointed by this film.I thought the first hour was slow and quite average.There was one great 10 minute scene in this movie but after that the film just falls apart.I have to say that Parasite and The Irishman were two critics favorites that I thought were mediocre films.
I would like to give it a 10/10 but small things just barely make me give it a 9. Overall a masterpiece in cinema
"Be A Host for Parasite The Stream: Are you going to complain that this is a foreign language film? Okay, fine. The Big Screen: Completely surprising at every turn. The Final Bill: Enjoy the ride. ? Trip Fontaine Parasite reminded me that there are actually some original ideas out there being made into movies. It also reminded me how annoyed I am by all of the sequels and remakes and reboots that have flooded Hollywood and American mainstream movie theaters. Directed and co-written by Bong Joon Ho, who also directed Snowpiercer and Okja both of which are on Netflix, Parasite is a South Korean film with English subtitles about¡¦ well, this where reviewing this movie gets difficult because I don¡¯t want to spoil anything. Um¡¦ it¡¯s about an out of work family who through a series of events find work and surprising things occur. There is so much to admire about Parasite. The screenplay is so good because, while the setting may be foreign to American audiences, the story is familiar and takes unexpected turns that when you really think about them the turns were always somehow inevitable. The point of view is funny and insightful. The themes once completely revealed are devastatingly universal. A further boon to Parasite is that the cast is great. Each member of the cast gets to shine in their distinct ways. The chemistry is familial and easy. The father played by Song Kang Ho and the daughter played by Park So Dam are the standouts; but, uniformly, each character plays their essential part in this tale. I¡¯ll also note how the production design is architecturally awe-inspiring and meticulous. The sets that were built for the film tell just as much of the story by just existing as do the dialogue and the actors. Parasite is an absolute must-see. If it is in a theater near you, take the opportunity to enjoy this spectacle on the big screen. Do not read any spoilers. Go into this one knowing as little as possible."
"Incredibly overrated. It is basically a Korean take on the Japanese movie ""shoplifters"", that tries so hard for satire with exagerated characters, scenes and plot lines. The goal is to shock not to create real art."
"De las mejores pel?culas de 2019, si bien empieza medio lento, se crea un nudo sensacional y cierra en un final muy pero muy memorable. Los actores son todos brillantes, no hay uno que haga mal su trabajo."
"I love how this manages to be a crowd-pleasing, straight-forward and accesible film but also a thought-provoking, well shot, incredibly well written and acted movie. It's so much in so little time. This movie achieves to be in like five different genres and never feels inconsistent. The transition from a standard drama to a comedy, then to a horror film, then to back to a drama, back to a comedy and so on feels so natural and never took me away from the movie. This might be one of the most funny non-comedy films of 2019, one of the best acted, one of the best written and one of the most entertaining yet complex films I've seen in 2019. There wasn't a single moment that felt slow or boring, the movie never stops and constantly moves forward to show us something new about the characters and the story and does it in an incredibly entertaining and engaging way. This movie is also really intense. It creates tension so well while also making you laugh or feel scared or disturbed. It's just too much to handle. It's a complete cinematic experience that I think I didn't get with any other movie I saw last year and I've at least seen all the Best Picture Oscar nominations and I have to say that this is the best out of all of them. Like the director said in his Golden Glibes speech: ""Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films"" and he's absolutely right."
I thought it was really good and really well done. The only thing that brought it down for me a little bit was that the resolution dragged on.
"An instant classic that keeps you hooked from beginning to end. It is easy to watch, but deep and ambiguous at the same time, with outstanding performances and excelent direction by Bong Joon Ho."
One if the best movies of 2019. Awesome Director and very awesome casts. Congratulations!
"Bong Joon Ho¡¯s 2019 release opens with a sub-ground level view out of a semi-basement window outlooking the alleyway of a Korean slum that will play the setting for most of the first act of the film. As the camera settles on this view, Hangul characters discreetly faze into frame and are quickly translated to the American title: Parasite. This seemingly menacing title (for who has any good memories of a parasite?) is in stark contrast to the equally seemingly innocuous backdrop. This opening frame acts as the films first (of many) contradictions that keeps the viewer intrigued and constantly guessing what will happen next all the way up to its thrilling and touching finale. The film centers around the Kim family: a hard-on-their luck family existing (just barely) amongst the previously mentioned alleyways of the slums that make up the bedrock of this unnamed Korean metropolitan. The family is shown as goofy, well-meaning, cheap, and ultimately entirely relatable. The interesting characters are brought to life by the apparently impeccable talents of the entire main cast. Kang-ho Song acts as patriarch to the Kim family but never acts as the boss. Each family member has a strength to balance any apparent weaknesses they may have. The performances are broad yet nuanced and the dialogue reaches every emotion on the spectrum while always maintaining a hint of comedy. Every character is given a chance to pine as well as get a laugh. If the trailers and posters scare or baffle you, know this: the acting in this movie is worth the cost of admission on its own. The cinematography and writing are all icing on this character-driven cake. That¡¯s not to say the look and writing of this film are not high points on their own. American viewers will automatically find the Korean setting to be a breath of fresh air with great shots of modern architecture contrasting the dreary shambles of the slums. In every frame of the film, the filmmaker attempts to make the background just as important a character as the people delivering lines. And as the viewers become more accustomed to the diverse settings, the plot constantly creates doubt in our securities and hints at something sinister behind every corner. At the moment you feel most safe, Bong introduces something new that shakes and upturns every notion you built up to that point. This all culminates in a showdown that both strips the viewer of all safety while at the same time establishes a new hope. Walking into the cinema as this film begins, the viewer has a pretty good idea of what kind of film they are in for. But as each scene shifts and every conversation is had in the film, the viewer is treated to something completely new and equally satisfying. The viewer will laugh and cry, cheer and gasp, all while cringing and gripping their seats and this is not an experience offered often to a modern audience. In an age of paint-by-numbers blockbusters, this gem offers a shining example of how great storytelling can be different and completely unsafe. Bong Joon Ho¡¯s own concern about Western audiences reservations about subtitled films rang even more resonant after my viewing as Parasite offers one of the best reasons to hurdle that 1-inch barrier."
"Lo primero que vemos en Parasite es la ventana de un s?tano que da a ras de suelo de una calle iluminada por el sol. Y nos quedamos con esta imagen hasta que se da el primer movimiento de c?mara del filme, cuando ?sta desciende y, sentado en el suelo del s?tano, vemos a uno de los protagonistas de esta ?ltima producci?n de de Bong Joon-ho. Solo con eso, el director y el cinemat?grafo han establecido el tema principal de la pel?cula, que ser? desarrollado a lo largo de 132 minutos: el lugar que ocupan los pobres y los marginados. Bong Joon-ho es un cineasta muy sencillo. Sus pel?culas cuentan historias complejas, de profundo contenido social, pero siempre utilizando los recursos cinematogr?ficos m?s b?sicos para reforzarlos. Sus pel?culas son, para el ojo entrenado, lo que una sinfon?a de Bethoveen es para un o?do entrenado: sublimes. Y lo mejor de todo es que no necesitas a?os de entrenamiento tipo conservatorio para apreciar lo sublime en los filmes de Joon-ho. Solo necesitas mirar con atenci?n. Todo est? en los ?ngulos y los movimientos de c?mara. Es con ellos que Bong Joon-ho deletrea los aspectos m?s importantes de su trama, mientras el guion y las actuaciones se encargan de desarrollarla. Para eso el director coreano se vale de un control absoluto de lo que muestra, c?mo lo muestra y a qu? ritmo lo muestra. Hay que pensar en sus pel?culas como coreograf?as entre el elenco y la c?mara, llenas de escenas en las que cada movimiento importa porque todo relata o refuerza algo. Por eso Joon-ho nunca se complica demasiado con su cinematograf?a ?aunque s? con los objetos, la profundidad y los colores de su dise?o de escenarios?, y m?s bien mantiene sus ?ngulos y movimientos de c?mara dentro de lo b?sico y consistente. De esta forma, una vez que entramos en ritmo, podemos bailar con su filme, tal como el elenco est? danzando con la c?mara. Y eso nunca fue m?s cierto que en Parasite (2019), donde Bong Joon-ho refina su habilidad de ser leve en el caos y oscuro en la levedad. Como dije ya, la pel?cula comienza con un movimiento de c?mara que nos introduce a la pobreza de un hogar de gente que tiene que hacer de todo para conseguir dinero y sobrevivir. A lo largo del filme los veremos abajo, intentando ascender y logr?ndolo a medida que la pel?cula es una divertida y perversa comedia en la que esta familia pobre se infiltra como la servidumbre de un lujoso hogar de gente adinerada. Es tan b?sico y consistente el lenguaje visual de Joon-ho que a esta familia adinerada la muestra siempre arriba: ubica su hogar en las colinas, los separa de su servidumbre por l?neas naturales del escenario, los pone en espacios iluminados y abiertos para remarcar la claustrofobia en la que viven los otros, los marginados. Parasite es un filme que est? en constante di?logo consigo mismo. Cada acto, cada escena, tienen una consecuencia a lo largo de una pel?cula cuyo giro pareciera cambiarla por completo. Bong Joon-ho es un maestro del tono, puede hacerte re?r en un momento oscuro y despertar un miedo dentro de ti en el momento m?s rid?culo. Pero en Parasite esto es m?s intenso. De una comedia perversa pasamos a un caos contundente, a algo tan extra?o y tan violento que seguramente es cierto. Y en realidad es un giro de trama que no hace m?s que reforzar el tema principal: el lugar de la pobreza en la sociedad, c?mo funciona la divisi?n de clases o, en palabras del mismo Joon-ho, c?mo en una sociedad capitalista la uni?n solo es posible en c?mo una clase utiliza a la otra. ¢®Y el elenco! Cada actor y actriz encarnan a sus personajes de una manera tan efectiva, que no dudamos de ellos ni cuando la historia da su giro. Joon-ho ha trabajo con grandes como Tilda Swimton, Jake Gyllenhall, Ed Harris, Chris Evans y los resultados son incre?bles, pero habla muy bien de ?l que pueda hacer lo mismo y hasta tal vez m?s con un elenco de su Corea del Sur natal ?entre ellos su actor mimado Song Kang-ho? desconocidos para una gran mayor?a. Para cuando llega el final de la pel?cula ?ese final delirante que nos deletrea la imposibilidad de ascender que tienen la clase baja y hasta la clase media?, el elenco ha hecho tan buen trabajo que ese ?ltimo golpe de la trama a los personajes, es tambi?n un golpe a nosotros, a nuestras propias fantas?as econ?micas, es un llamado a mirar de nuevo como dividimos las clases en nuestras sociedades."
Simply a fantastic movie and one that should serve as a standard for future films about relevant social themes.
Such incredible thriller with attractive flow of story. This is a must-see movie of 2019.
"Basically bad to very bad. Humorous first half turns violent and disgusting. I get that it¡¯s railing against the system, but do we really need buckets of blood to say that? Would avoid ."
One of the most well-crafted movie put in history. Each scene is paced like a swiss watch. Bong Joon Ho is a master crafting a masterpiece
"To sum this movie it up, it is a black comedy, a thriller, a horror and a social satire in 2 hours. Seems like a lot in 2 hours, but not only is the message of class division clear, Bong presents it in the most accessible and humorous way¡¦ Expand"
"Overrated AF,the first half of this movies is amazing but then becomes just unfunny and predictable."
"Parasite is the kind of movie that needs to be seen by everyone. This film is funny, is suspenseful, is a satire, it has everything. Bong Joon Ho has created a complete masterpiece fill with amazing performances, great cinematography, excellent music and a screenplay that will be studied for years to come."
"Korean satire about social class differences turns into slapstick comedy implicitly contemptuous of working class and poor as schemers, scammers and pointlessly violent. That is, pointless relative to the social class satire it seeks to portray. The film ends with a stereotypical working class dream, stereotypical from the standpoint of the wealthy. The last half of the film drags. Well filmed and acted, it is nonetheless at its core a vastly overrated movie. Just enough for wealthier liberals to feel a bit good, to think there's something here that isn't."
"A really good movie, there's no much about it that can be said without spoiling it, but it was worth the time."
"I can't recommend enough this movie to anybody, it has amazing rhythm and editing that it makes it look like it is easy. The plot slowly but surely unveils and it gives you enough clues for you to uncover a lot of its themes beforehand, not that is predictable mind you, but is not unfair or cheap, so several views are recommended. I don't want to speak a lot of the plot so I won't spoil anything, but is not only an extremely well done and entertaining movie, it also serves as an actual social commentary about the poor and the wealth, it is also so well written that it doesn't tell you a moral, it makes you question yours. Please see it with an open mind and make your own conclusions."
"Parasite is a wonderful experience. It's grounded in the amazing realism of our actual world, but given a bit of a push into the surreal. What if the 99% infiltrated each others lives to get closer to something like the lives of the 1%? It's a tasty premise fully realized. The acting is fantastic, and its funny as hell. I'm sure everyone will take something different from it, it's one of those truly skilled works of art that most filmmakers can only hope to attain after a lifetime of creating. Watch it. The audience I saw it with was highly confused and you probably will be too."
"insane of ths 2019. The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes"
"The reputation this has developed as movie of the year is well earned, it is beautifully photographed, perfectly acted and scripted. There is not much else to add, i bet there is an american remake on the way, it will win best picture."
"La pel?cula es magn?fica, la historia es narrada desde el punto de vista de la clase baja y lo hace de una forma muy profunda."
"This movie really left me speechless. Parasite is probably the most different movie of recent times. The plot is light at first, but it becomes increasingly bizarre. The direction of Bong Joon-Ho is very simple, ensuring the viewer a very comfortable experience. The script is intriguing and curious, can keep the viewer completely glazed in the story. These are very good performances by Koreans, which show true performances. The movie ends up getting a little lost in the final act, but nothing that spoils the experience. It is very worth it. Parasite is a great movie."
"this movie so cool. for those who dont like thriller its ok. all thriller on near ending, the quality overall is good."
"Bong Jon-ho and the rest of Korean cinema is giving Hollywood a run for its money, and this film is a proof of that. The fact that Western audiences praises this flick like its the second coming is a little too much. Yes, it is highly original, and yes, it shifts its tone from broad comedy to thriller with incredible ease, but Korean cinema has been doing that for the last 2 decades or so. If it takes this flick for film fans to be aware of this incredible film industry, then so be it."
"i just can¡¯t fathom life without this gorgeous **** movie. this changed the way i see film, and its storytelling is enough to haunt you for weeks. i don¡¯t know where to begin even dissecting this, just go watch it for yourself and watch history in the making."
Amazing. I really don't have words to describe how I felt watching this. It was dark and sad but also funny at the same time. It completely trapped me.
Parasite is one the best movies I have watched hands down! Highly recommended
"You may be 14, you may be 40. You may be Korean, Russian or Belgian. None of those matter because there is one certitude: You will LOVE this masterpiece and it's universal, original story. On top of that it has great actors, beautiful cinematography, it's fantastically paced and just a lot of fun really. Realising what the fuss was all about after watching it is a twist in itself. Enjoy !"
This movies make me sad. I just thought why everything in this world be like this why humen be like this.
The movie is the best of the year. There will always be movies like this Befitting oscar
"Good movie to spend an evening with your friends. A little comedy here is fine, but you won't laugh a lot."
"Parasite stands atop the rest of the competition as the best film of 2019. Director Bong Joon-ho delivers his masterpiece, a film that has you hooked from the very beginning. Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. Just when your investment in the characters peaks, Bong Joon-ho takes Parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes. Add in fantastic performances and cinematography, and you have the must-see film of 2019."
"Did I watch the parody of the ""Parasites"" movie that gets such glorious reviews? The rich family had believable characters, but all the grifters in the story were absolutely not believable. The brutally graphic ending was comical, an over exaggerated blood bath mirroring the graphic ending in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (which by the way I loved). The scene was just that absurd. If I had gone solo, I'd have walked out. As it was, I had to force myself to stay with my date as the urge to leave kept waving over me."
"A very pleasant surprise of how to combine something mysterious, and something with great horror elements but keeping it light with perfect black humor and not to give away too much at any point. The movie has this soft tension build up all throughout story progression and never really settles down on one tone. Shortly after the start you kind of get the idea where things go, but you have no clue what is going to happen after that and how the protagonists are going to deal with the difficulties they are facing. The script was very cleverly written, makes you face a decision who you are rooting for. I could sympathize with either the ¡°good guys¡± or the ¡°bad guys¡± at any given point during the movie. This movie should be a great example to Hollywood how to write and direct an original title, this is a Korean gem that will go down as one of the best in its genre and category."
"Sin ser la pel?cula redonda que la cr?tica parece hacernos creer, s? que la he disfrutado en el cine debido a ese toque de realismo en el comportamiento humano y, sobre todo, a su cr?tica social que, sin ser demasiado profunda, siempre se agradece que se tenga en cuenta. La interpretaci?n de todo el reparto cumple sobradamente y nos ayuda a situarnos tanto en la primera mitad de la pel?cula, m?s amable, como en la segunda mitad m?s cruda. Las dudas que pueda plantearte quedan disueltas con un final brillante."
"The first hours of Parasite is a whirlwind of fun, fascinating, and engaging ideas. Beautiful and inspiring cinematography. The second hour, plus, devolves into a repetitive, rude, ignorant, and self-absorbed malfunction of a movie and screenplay. Bong should have stopped while he was ahead."
"From South Korea, the movie that will be the worst nightmare of Almodovar and Scorsese. Dark comedy, drama and suspense in the vein of Hitchcock are mixed masterly in the story for a family of phonies and his **** art of getting away with it, or almost. Unexpected twists and an unpredictable end will make this one be tattoed in the memory of viewer. Rush!"
Very good. -----------------------------------------------------------------
"When you see ""Parasite"" your eyes will be so glued to the screen that they will feel sore if you take them off, this film is a near perfect conglomeration of social-political satire, heist film tension, and superb tonal shifts."
"Incr?vel, fenomenal, sucesso total. Uma verdediera obra de 2019, filme traz toda uma relev?ncia para o debate atual sobre qualidade de vida, desigualdade social, luta de classes, viol?ncia."
"The black humour and some scenes are so funny, that they make the movie already very good. But it is also clever in the beginning, where it shows, how the parasite family is getting into the rich family. Fortunately the movie doesnt show the rich family as evil, but they seems to be too simple."
"Parasite is satirical, but it's not meant to make you laugh hysterically. It's more sophisticated than that. It takes some unexpected turns that kept it interesting throughout. There is a turning point in the film when everything clearly starts heading towards a chaotic finish, and it delivered well."
"Well...This film is almost a masterpiece, for its genre. Visually stunning, brilliant acting, amazing direction by Bong Joon Ho, and a captivating story drive this film to incredible heights. I¡¯m never too keen on foreign-language films as I can¡¯t really understand them even with the captions, but this just glorified them. The only thing I¡¯d say about this film that doesn¡¯t really drive the movie down for me is the pacing was a tad slow, but that would be me nitpicking for any mistakes. Overall, one of 2019¡¯s best for sure."
House under water and tent over the water. The movie PARASITE is the reality we do not want to see.
"Brilliant. The writing, acting and directing combine for a social satire that I still can't get out of my mind. The images will haunt you, and bring home the real divide that exists across the world - that of class - and its cost in human terms."
"Um dos melhores filmes de 2019, sem sombras de duvidas! Uma surpresa que me pegou em cheio. Talvez esse seja o filme mais completo que j? assisti. Ele tem diversos g?neros, mas n?o assume nenhum. Tem diversos dilemas e reflex?es, mas n?o se abst?m deles. Cont?m um finale t?o impressionantemente imprevis?vel que ? de t? tira o ar. Fora as atua??es que est?o perfeitamente bem alocadas."
"Not a fan of the director (I loathed Snowpiercer) and movies with this must critical acclaim usually ****. But by far the movie of the year. In tone, in terms of black humor/crime/thriller it ""feels"" like the same world as Joker. Amazing visuals and lots of interesting layers to sift through. I think you can watch it just as a movie and enjoy it. It's not supposed to be realistic, but stylized, so go in knowing that. But pay attention and this movie is deeply rewarding. The disgust the rich people have for what was found in the car and how they use it in role play later on... the father telling his son that planning life doesn't work and then the ending... the subtle and clever aspects of the class struggle and how the house plays into it. So many layers if you want to look for it. This is an astonishing piece of well crafted fiction."
"The most fun and surprising film of the decade. A crowd-pleaser for critics and the general public alike. One of the finest works of Bong JoonHo and his amazing cast. An almost faultless film, with nothing but attention-grabbing scenes from start to finish. A mix of dark comedy, drama, thriller, and themes on social class make this film enjoyable and interesting without any particular protagonist or antagonist in the plot."
"Mi punto de vista e impresiones: Una s?tira sobre las clases sociales que en definitiva no dejar? indiferente a nadie. Es dif?cil encasillar a esta pel?cula en un g?nero porque realmente tiene de todo. Le? excelentes cr?ticas que la calificaban como una de las mejores pel?culas del a?o y de la d?cada y ahora que acabo de verla, es completamente cierto, en mi opini?n tiene todos los m?ritos para ubicarse en el primer puesto de la mejor pel?cula del a?o, disculpando a Joker y a Midsommar que hasta el momento compart?an el primer puesto, pero me tomar? el atrevimiento de ubicarlas a ambas en el segundo lugar y a Parasite no hay nada que la saque del primer puesto y saben el por qu?? La trama es interesante, los personajes son fabulosos y muy ingeniosos, el ritmo es atraparte y el gui?n y direcci?n son absolutamente incre?bles, ambos son sumamente inteligentes, mordaces y por sobre todo sublimes, estoy realmente fascinado por la pel?cula que acabo de ver, se las recomiendo a todo dar. Sobra decir que le doy 5 de 5"
"This movie forces me to make this review. It's a masterpiece, watch it, you will never forget it."
"I usually don't watch movies, my attention span is simply just too short for so many of them. Its for that sole reason I stick mainly to just thrillers and suspense, productions that will keep me at the edge of my seat. And oh boy Parasite does not disappoint in that aspect in any way whatsoever. Its a movie full of twists, one wont know what hit 'em.."
"The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended."
"I actually think this may be the best movie I've seen this year. Very well done, its funny, dark, emotional, intriguing and definitely will keep you on your toes for what happens next which is very unpredictable. A very good story line and well directed. Bravo!"
Congrats To Director To Pick This Story For The Genre ! It Changes My Mind That Cheating Is Not Bad If The Purpose Is Survival ! This Movie Also Shows Slaverysm And Racism In Reality As No People Shows It Directly To Our Face ! Acting Is Excellent ! Cameraman Deserves An Award ! Ending Was The Best ! Plot Twist Also Attratcts The Audience ! This Story Is So Difficult To Be Done In A Fast Screenplay ! But They Convey The Feelings Successfully
"I liked Snowpiercer, didn¡¯t care for Okja but Parasite was about as perfect as a film can be. A hilarious and brutal depiction of inter and intra class struggle. Must see; not just best of the year but one of the best of all time."
"Amazing film. Authentic, real, and a story I have never seen put to film before. Highly recommend. 10/10"
"Parasite is funny and clever at the same time. Through trickster reality, plot is developed under a lot of intelligence and it's almost impossible doesn't hold yourself until movie's end. Probably this year's best movie."
"Easily the best movie of 2019. A great movie, it entertains, it thrills and it shocks, thanks to a perfect direction by Bong and some incredible performances from the cast."
"This is the best film of the year. It is beautiful. thought-provoking, and truly is the most shocking/surprising gems that have been created. The plot centres around a family struggling to get buy and make ends meet. That is all I'll say in regards to the plot. It's something to experience and watch unfold. I didn't know anything about the film walking in and was blown away. Totally recommended."
I rarely log in to write a review. This move made me instantly log in to post one.
"This movie has a little something for everyone; comedy, drama, thriller. A full palette of emotions, masterful cinematography and an immersive and believable story. I'd recommend this to anyone who is willing to anyone who is willing to watch a movie with subtitles. One of the best films I've seen all year."
"This movie was amazing!!! This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, director of The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer and more. This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I¡¯m a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. If that¡¯s an issue for you, don¡¯t see it. You won¡¯t enjoy it. Otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie! It¡¯s one of the best of the year!"
"Perfeito, o melhor filme do ano e n?o tem discuss?o. Dire??o, roteiro e montagem no m?ximo. Bong Joon-ho est? em outro n?vel."
"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece. This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible. Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You. In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absolutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING."
"Es una pel?cula buena, pero sobrevalorada. Pens? que hab?a algo m?s oculto en la pel?cula que no me hab?a dado cuenta, as? que busqu? m?s informaci?n y reviews, pero no hay nada m?s. La verdad es una pel?cula que entretiene, a pesar de ser muy larga, pero no tiene nada especial. No es de sorprender que est? tan sobrevalorada por la cr?tica, porque la cr?tica ha evolucionado para mal, ahora son m?s doble-moral que nunca, estigmatizan unas pel?culas y sobrevaloran otras. Entonces, yo recomiendo que la vean y saquen sus conclusiones, pero hay tantos cabos sueltos en la pel?cula, que es absurda, adem?s la pel?cula lleva una l?nea interesante, a la cual se le da un giro inesperado, muy bueno, pero el hilo inicial se pierde, luego comenzamos a ver un mont?n de cosas agregadas que tampoco es normal, muy absurdas dir?a yo. :::Alerta de Spoiler::: El final es totalmente est?pido, el asesinato al padre del ni?o por un gesto, se supo que pasar?a en ese momento por la tensi?n de la pel?cula, ¢¯Pero no es totalmente absurdo?. Nunca hubo algo que hablara del resentimiento del se?or por su condici?n, as? que fue algo sin base, adem?s ¢¯A d?nde se ir?a a esconder? Hasta un ni?o de 5 a?os pudo deducirlo, pero no la polic?a, al parecer son muy ineptos en esa ciudad. Pero no en colmo con eso, a?aden una parte final de un supuesto futuro, en el que el mejor plan para recuperar a su padre y dejarlo impune, es hacerse millonario y comprar la casa donde est? escondido; La idea m?s idiota de todas."
¢¯La mejor pel?cula del a?o? - Posiblemente. ¢¯Obra maestra? - Totalmente. Esta es la primera pel?cula del 2019 que se convertir? en un cl?sico y un gran referente para los cineastas de aqu? en adelante.
"You know a movie's good when you wind up having a dream about it. The last movie that affected me that way was Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The latest to affect me that way is Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. The only other movie I've seen from Bong is Snowpiercer, a film that dealt with the issues of class inequality, in Parasite he returns to this theme, but this time he plays it from a very realistic angle. Bong captures the tension of class disparity superbly, blending grittiness, humour and horror, and striking imagery that completely immerses you in the world he created. The actors all do a superb job, especially Kang Ho-Song, who best exemplifies through his performance, what it feels like to be on the less-fortunate end of the class spectrum. The writing is superb too, in particular how it portrays the struggle to move up the class ladder, using both the optimistic practicality of ""planning"" and pessimistic impracticality of ""dreaming"", in a hard-hitting way. This movie forces you to ride the wave with our main characters, all the way up, and down. The cinematography is beautiful, and the images composed superbly. The way the cinematography captures the architecture of our more-fortunate characters home is breathtaking, so is their lifestyle. No wonder our main characters plot and dream of being in that position, who wouldn't want to be?. The score stands out too. At times it gets super eerie and spacy and combined with the imagery, it helps produce the feeling that you are in a fever dream, and trust me, when the **** hits the fan in this, it's a fever dream and then some. I highly recommend this hard-hitting bit of cinema."
"Una pelicula impredecible, llena de intriga y giros argumentales, tienes que verla sin saber nada de ella, eso har? que disfrutes mucho mejor"
"Electrifying! Top five movie of the year. Lives up to the rave reviews. Deservedly won Best Film at Cannes Festival. Director at the top of his form! Black comedy, satire, thriller, amazing."
"? um filme interessante, algumas piadas funcionam mais a maioria n?o, e ele ? muito longo e cansativo, mais o plano da familia para serem contratados foi bom"
Such a good movie. Probably one of the best films ever created. Takes you on a roller coaster of emotions
"""Parasite"" is about as close to perfect as a film can possibly get. I have zero complaints. Nothing. Give it the Oscar. This is the film that people who have tried to make a case for ""Us"" as a Film of the Year contender should watch. It achieves a lot of the same goals while being far better."
"I wasn't sure what I would find with Parasite beyond the expectations I had for the excellent reviews it has received so far. But if I should emphasize something about it is its unpredictability in a story that thematically emanates an amazing dramatic darkness and at the same time manages to balance it with a touch of black comedy and certain elements of a mystery thriller. Parasite is a film completely controlled and designed to be unraveled delicately while you consume its social commentary and understand both sides of the social spectrums of both families and the ending leaves a bitter lesson and yet nothing lacking reality. You will talk about it quite a bit after finishing it Parasite is the kind of cinema that is always welcome and always necessary. Disturbing, dramatic, funny and unpredictable: A triumph."
"This movie was really **** cinematography was incredible and every shot that was filmed was done so **** film also does great with mixing comedy,tragedy and suspenfullness.I have barely watched any Korean movies(except train to busan) but i can see that Koreans are making really good movies so i will have to keep an eye on their movies since they really do emotional movies great."
"After 10 minutes I was ready to leave ""Parasite"" but I can count on one hand how many movies I have walked out on so I decided to stay and find out why word of mouth was being so positive about the film. Basically it is the story of how a very poor family of 4, parents, son and daughter scams their way into the home of a very wealthy family of 4 consisting of the parents, daughter and son. Really can't talk about the movie itself without giving spoilers, though none of them jolted and/or surprised me. The movie is 2 hours and 13 minutes of which 13 minutes could have been cut very easily or spent in explaining some relationships that are sort of glossed over. ""Parasite"" takes place in Korea and the differences between the classes are made immediately. The film has subtitles that took me a few minutes to get used to but to which I adapted fairly quickly. I left the theatre glad I didn't walk out but at the same time I really can't see recommending it while, on the other hand, Allen thought it was a classic whodunit."
"The most prominent aspect of the movie that appealed to me personally, was how the camera takes its time revealing a scene. Just like someone who is watching something unfold in front of them but not completely grasp what they are seeing. It takes on the role of a curious bystander watching it knowing something big is about to happen but not knowing when. In a few words, the movie is - Hilarious, Tragic, Scary and Thrilling at the same time."
This is not only the best movie of 2019. This is the best movie of the decade. Just go see it.
"There's an unmatched clarity and precision to Bong Joon Ho's filmmaking. Parasite doesn't fit neatly into a genre box--it's part drama, part thriller, and part mystery--and the overall spectacle is indeed a worthy winner of Cannes Film Festival's top prize, the Palm d'Or."
"The biggest surprise of the year. I went to watch the movie without knowing very well what I was going to find, and I left delighted. The artistic direction is 10/10, and the mix of drama, comedy and thriller make the two hours and peak that the movie lasts by flying. Totally recommended."
"The Park family is struggling financially, when the son gets a job teaching English to the daughter of the rich Kim family. In a short time, he brings his parents and sister to work for them¡¦then things take a very dark turn. The film is a bit slow in the first 3rd (maybe straining to make sure the financial inequality theme is clear), but once the twists start, it departs into unexpected areas (literally and figuratively). Director Bong Joon Ho (best known for Snowpiercer) continues to showcase his skills at creating unique and disturbing storytelling. The combo of humor, suspense and violence lends this film an intelligent, yet visceral quality that's sure to stimulate and surprise. (Korean with subtitles)"
"In ¡°Parasite,¡± Writer/Director Bong Joon Ho continues his critique of capitalist economies that, in his judgment, inevitably create economic divides resulting in class warfare. In his earlier films ¡°Okja¡± (2017) and ¡°Snowpiercer¡± (2013), Bong used a platform of science fiction to soften the message. With ¡°Parasite,¡± he employs slapstick and dark humor to leaven a story that, in lesser hands, might have become painfully didactic. Setting his story in Seoul, Bong has the benefit of dealing with class warfare and economic inequality without the complication of race. South Korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous countries in the world ? 96% of the population is Korean. Bong¡¯s pacing of his story is impeccable. In Act One, we are introduced to the Kim family, literally and figuratively living in the lower reaches of the city, the parents unemployed and struggling, the kids getting by on street smarts. When workers come by spraying white clouds of pesticide in their rodent-infested section of the city, the father advises to leave the windows open: ¡°It¡¯s free extermination.¡± At the other end of the economic spectrum is the Park family, wealthy beyond reason and totally reliant on others to do anything requiring physical or mental heavy lifting. Bong underlines his premise by conveying clearly that, while they have great wealth, the Parks are not endowed with a particularly high level of intelligence, common sense or self-awareness. When a wealthy friend of the Kim son creates an opportunity for him to tutor the Park daughter, the Kims use this entry point as leverage, creating jobs for every member of the family within the Park household. So far, the story, is light, bright and slapstick, with only a small vein of dark humor. This tone offers opportunities for non-threatening exposition. Remarking on the Parks¡¯ unlined faces, Mr. Kim intones: ¡°Money is like an iron. It smooths the creases out.¡± In Act Two, the story takes a darker turn, initially by exploring the consequences of the Kims¡¯ actions on one of the displaced workers. By the end of the film, class warfare has escalated from bland observations (Mr. Park observes that those who ride on the subway have a ¡°special smell¡±) to full-on emotional and physical violence. For me, Bong¡¯s thoughtful, subtly-crafted story invoked a fair amount of thought and introspection. ¡°Parasite¡± won the top prize at this year¡¯s Cannes Film Festival and is South Korea¡¯s entry for Best International Feature Film at the Oscars. It¡¯s one of the finest films of the year."
"This is a Korean film that I can't quite categorize! I don't know whether to consider it a comedy, drama, thriller, dark comedy, etc., as it contains so many elements of all these genres. One thing I do know is certain though, this is such an interesting and unbelievable film in virtually every way possible! Winner of the Palme d'Or (the French equivalent of an Academy Award) earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival, this film follows a poor Korean family that attempts to insert themselves into the lives of a rich, upper-class suburban family by getting themselves hired for various jobs for the family, such as a math tudor, chauffeur, cook, etc. They seem intent on even replacing the family and claiming the house for themselves if possible, until they stumble upon something shocking and unexpected within the house. And to say too much else beyond that would ruin the amazing experience of viewing this film for the first time! Really, all I can say is this: No other film this year had me laughing so much during one moment, and then completely on the edge of my seat during another, with certain scenes even leaving me absolutely breathless and speechless! The acting, writing, and dialogue were all so brilliant and razor-sharp as well! The film is layered with so many unexpected twists and turns! I never knew where this film was going or what it'd morph or evolve into next, as each scene and moment always felt so radically different and unpredictable than the last! On top of all that, the film undeniably provides a unique subtext on class, social status, the lengths some will go to for prosperity, and how people within certain classes are often perceived. Overall, I can't even begin to heap enough praise towards this masterpiece of a film! It had just about everything to offer, combined so many favorite elements and genres of mine, and left me flabbergasted by the end to the point where I sat through the entire credits and then some in order to properly process and sit with what I'd just watched! This is far and out one of the best films of the year, maybe even the decade!"
"I am speechless. It doesn't get any better than this. This film is a masterpiece and I can't see any better coming this year. Joon-ho Bong keeps on getting better and it's one of the best storytellers of our times, with this film being his Magnum Opus. It touches so many aspects of life with geniality and a dash of dark humor. All is a metaphor and all is explicit, genius. After only one week of it's premier, in my country, I went to one of the few theaters were this film was actually available. Expecting to have a room for myself, this little theater was full, completely full. It just demonstrates that people look also for something more than all the regurgitated bull**it that Hollywood has to offer. Don't miss this film and enjoy it."
"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it¡¯s not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film¡¯s message is a little on the nose but I don¡¯t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film¡¯s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film¡¯s story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It¡¯s so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it¡¯s always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I¡¯m using the word tension a lot but that¡¯s what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."
"With a first act that unfolds like something of a cheeky Aesop fable for the 21st century, a third act that feels like something straight out of a true crime novel, and a second act that somehow ties these two disparate bookends together, ""Parasite"" effortlessly skyrockets into the heights of memorability for not only this year, but for the past few years, as this is one movie I'm going to have a hard time shaking for days, if not weeks from now. There's so much to every layer of this movie, and co-writer/director Bong Joon-Ho's refreshingly specific vision is the fulcrum of it all. The narrative is so unique, featuring a latter half that's chock-full of events you absolutely can't see coming. The imagery and colors within each frame grow in terms of vibrance as the film goes on. And the overall tone is so brilliantly difficult to pin down to just one note, ultimately giving this movie one of the most incredibly specific voices I've heard in a theater for quite some time. It is, without a doubt, one of the year's greatest feats to behold."
"A great film that deserved to win the Palme D¡¯Or at Cannes. In a strange way, it¡¯s a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, but much more cutthroat and much more fun. You never quite know what will happen next with such wily servants and such clueless and pampered rich people."
"This is South Korean movie from a famous Korean director Bong Joon Ho. I saw a few movies made by him, a drama ""Mother"" and a SciFi ""Snowpiercer"" and I liked both of them. This latest movie ""Parasite"" won the most prestigious prize at Cannes festival, Palme d'Or this year. My expectations were mixed: on one hand, both critics and audience *loved* the movie. On the other hand, it's a black comedy: not my thing. So I went to see it. What can I say? Maybe I am missing something here. I found it not funny at all. Performances were poor. The script - ridiculous. The movie is long: more than two hours. I felt an urge to leave after one hour but I fought it. After an hour and a half I finally left, I could not stand it any longer. I feel like I am not supposed to rate it since I haven't seen it in its entirety but if I had to, it would be 3 out of 10. Once again, I am probably missing something here since it is not my genre. If you usually like black comedies, you may enjoy it as so many people do."
The best movie ever! Really amazed by the movie and the actors. Happy to see Koreans making good movies.
It is plain and simple the best movie of this year. Parasite keeps evolving and changing while being always engaging and fun. It is one of the best movie watching experiences you will ever experience - a must-see.
"Um dos melhores filmes desse s?culo at? o momento, sem d?vidas! Apenas assistam e procurem saber o menos poss?vel para terem uma experi?ncia surreal de vida."
"Bong Joon Ho's most recent movie is nothing short than a masterpiece. With great acting performances, beautiful cinematography, an interesting story and weirdly likable characters and a very satisfying third act, Parasite is an instant classic."
"The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more."
"Absolutely beautiful, disturbing, and politically timely. I was blown away by Parasite! Go in blind, with no expectations, and you will be shocked to your core!"
"This movie is arguably the best thriller I have seen in years. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire runtime, and I can honestly say I never knew what was going to happen next. I am not going to spoil any plot elements in this review, because I believe you should be as shocked as I was by the time the credits rolled! Every single element that went into crafting Parasite is flawless. The composition of every single shot was immaculate. The soundtrack was intense and beautiful. The acting was out of this world phenomenal. The direction is beautiful. The writing is very well done, and, a lot like Joker, is political without being political. Parasite has a lot to say about classism, and it touches on the relationship of North and South Korea with a perspective that was completely new to me as an outsider. This is a masterfully crafted film, and I hope everyone who can see this movie does. This is truly Bong Joon-Ho's best work. I was **** into this movie, and I couldn't believe how good it was. I'm not the best at Oscar predictions or anything like that, but this movie won the Palme d'Or, very deservedly I might add! I think this will be a shoo-in for Best Foreign Language Film in all of the USA awards this year."
"Dissecting the struggle between the classes through the lens of innate human nature -- regardless of class status -- provides the foundation for this rip-roaring black comedy/social satire, one of those rare films that grabs your attention and holds it from start to finish without letting go. Building on themes explored in such previous works as ""Snowpiercer,"" writer-director Bong Joon Ho serves up a riveting, ruthless offering that makes its point clearly but without being heavy-handed or cartoonishly over the top. In doing so, the filmmaker dishes out a wealth of utterly hilarious humor about subjects that ultimately prove to be no laughing matter. Easily one of the year's best, sufficiently award-worthy in many respects, especially in its superb writing, the fine performances of its excellent ensemble cast and a thought-provoking message that should give us all a lot to think about."
"A totally unexpected movie, left me disturbed. It's so good that it feels kind of unreal to be created in 2019. Masterpiece & best one of the year."
"Parasite lives up to all the hype. It's funny, it's thrilling, it's heartbreaking, it's fun. Bong Joon Ho blew my mind. This film will probably remain in my mind forever. The must see movie of 2019!"
"I think my life is like that, it was a very deep and content film, thank you."
"¡°Parasite¡± is a South Korean film co-written and directed by Joon-ho Bong. It tells the story of two families whose fates and directions intersect and become interwined in a series of plot twists and turns that sometimes boggle the ability of the viewer to enjoy the film. This is a movie that just can¡¯t seem to make up its mind¡¦is it a comedy¡¦or is it a tragedy¡¦or is it both. Also confusing and somewhat annoying are the English titles that seem to clash against and appear inconsistent with the words being spoken by the actors. At a minimum this recurring inconsistency between the titles and the spoken words became for this writer, at least, a major distraction. Rarely have I seen a film receive such unwarranted and undeserving praise and accolade by the critics who I can¡¯t believe saw the same movie I did. I found the scenes in the film to be drawn out and the movie itself to be unnecessarily long, again the penalty for having the writer/director charged with editing (or failing to edit) his own work product. I give the film a 5.0 rating and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice nap in a movie house.."
It¡¯s never less than interesting and watchable but in the end for me there are so many better Korean movies that it doesn¡¯t live up to the hype of my expectations.
Fantastic filmmaking. One the most revolutionary Golden Palms in recent history. An exquisite popcorn flick that contains all your favorite genres in a two-hour long roller-coaster social satire
"""What happens to a dream deferred?"" (L. Hughes) Parasite creator Bong Joon-Ho agrees with Hughes that it could dry up, rot, stink, sag like a heavy load, and explode, but more importantly it devastates. A (probably) once charismatic and driven father, Ki-taek, reduces himself to a man with no plan. Further, he reveals to his son that this is the best plan of all - as you can't get let down that way. Classism rules the screen as the Philistine Park family does South Korea. They know no true love, no appreciation for art, and no hobbies, but their money buys them pseudo-happiness- at the expense of Ki-taek's family and the rest of the poor who share his scent. The director adds family dynamics, humor, suspense, gore, and scenery to a film that can only be categorized as art. Best film of the year!"
"'Parasite' is without question one of the best films of 2019 and I can see why Joon ho-Bong's film won the prestigious Palme d'Or prize at the Cannes film festival. This is the first film of his that I have seen and I undoubtedly have to watch more of them as I have been meaning to for some time. The film follows a family of a father, mother, son and daughter who are largely down on their luck and unemployed, living in a basement type flat with a low view onto a street usually occupied with a man who gets drunk and urinates down the street in full view of the family. Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) who is the son has a college friend called Min (Seo-joon Park) who visits his home and leaves the family a large rock that Min states will bestow wealth upon the family. Min tells Ki-woo that he is going abroad for study and asks him whether he would like to take over as English tutor for this young rich girl he has been tutoring himself. Ki-woo unsure of how he could considering he is not in college nor an english teacher is told by Min that his knowledge is better than most of his college friends and for him not to worry. Ki-woo is hired by the girl's mother Yeon-kyo Park (Yeo-jeong Jo) after he displays his ability to the mother, and this sets in motion a film that offers such varying emotions and surprises throughout that only a few directors of a very able nature could direct a film of this standard. A fantastic ensemble performance with I think particular praise going to Kang-ho Song as Ki-taek Kim the father. His transitions from comedy to drama are seamless as is the film itself and this blend of comedy and drama always lends a hand in making a film great when it is done well as it is in this case. The cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong was perfect and you can tell when you have an ensemble crew who are masters of their field. It is good to see an East Asian film garnering so much attention and awards buzz."
"Here it **** favorite movie from Asian cinema this year.Good Acting,good script and a good directing... Thank you Bong Joon-ho"
"Parasite is a twisty, energetic ride at the movies, balancing a light-heartedness with thriller-like tension. Aside from its enjoyability as a film - largely due to its superb cast and writing - Parasite makes a visually stunning statement on class and society in the modern age. It¡¯s not always perfect, and may stretch itself to wild extremes, but it¡¯s a cinematic experience you¡¯ll want to come back to again and again, and one of 2019¡¯s definite must-sees."
"Definitely worth watching and for my opinion the best foreign film of the year,"
"We are in 2019, and yet there is a movie that from the start till the end, I cannot predict what is going to happen. The most unique Korean movie, and definitely one of the best Korean movies and Bong Joon Ho's best directed movie I have ever seen."
"I have zero interest in Kdrama series, Kpop or just K-musical and cinema industry in general. But this movie, God damn that it's a must watch!"
"Absolutely incredible. One of Bong Joon-Ho's best. It's darkly funny, loaded with suspense, and has a deep socio-economic statement that's timely and deep. The cast is awesome, the direction is awesome, the music, the cinematography - everything is awesome. PARASITE, thus far, is easily my favorite film of the year."
"""You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned."" 'Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. Unpredictable and nuts. You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile. I admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work. Anywhere, Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best working directors alive and 'Parasite' proves it. The movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique. The performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why I was engaged throughout. I highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience. Overall rating: Finally, a breath of fresh air. My second favorite movie of this year."
"A delicious movie that keeps on serving every minute of its runtime. With gorgeous shots and incredible acting from the cast, this film will be remembered for years."
"Unpredictable, unique story, fantastic cinematography, and great acting. I can't recommend enough. At the moment this is easily my favorite movie of 2019."
Insanely good. I'm still shaken by it and deeply touched at the same time. I have no idea how Meta and Rotten tomatoes' rated Black Panther higher than this. Clearly something off.
"Absolutely magnificent movie from a great great filmmaker that always send the audience to a place that could just say: ""WoW, whatafuq...!"""
"My first korean movie, one of the best movies I saw this year, a simple comedic concept which goes into a complex development, amazing acting, emotional and excellent camera work, frame composition and color. I think its a 10 I'm not a critic and for me it felt refreshing and proved once again that asian know movies."
Disturbing but such a unique story with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.

Best Movie I¡¯ve seen this year. So thrilling and clever. Please watch it in the Theaters.
"MIND-PARASITIZING! One of the most exquisitely directed, and well-crafted, films of the decade. Give Joon-ho Bong an Oscar from now! (8.5/10)"
"I've seen a ton of movies this year, and this one is clearly in my top group. The storytelling is phenomenal, the visuals are beautiful, and even though things get a touch ""heavy"" in the final third with regard to driving the theme home, it's just an amazing film. The actors are uniformly fantastic. What starts as sort **** that's light and hilarious turns touching, and emotional. It's not as momentous as last year's Roma, but if there's justice, this one will get a Best Picture nod, and will actually have a shot to win. Of course, I'm not staking anything of value on that... I have a feeling that academy voters don't watch many of these films."
I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie. A definite must see for everyone.
"a **** Masterpiece, deserve all the awards, the best of 2019 without questioning"
Uma obra prima do cinema coreano e um dos melhores filmes de 2019. Sem mais.
"To sum this movie it up, it is a black comedy, a thriller, a horror and a social satire in 2 hours. Seems like a lot in 2 hours, but not only is the message of class division clear, Bong presents it in the most accessible and humorous way while being able to shock his viewer; and everything from the performance of the cast, to the script, to the cinematography and to the production is flawless and jaw dropping. Calling it a great movie is an understatement. Bong has created a masterpiece and what could possibly his best film so far. Go watch the movie as soon as possible. If you love cinema, this is one movie you have to watch. It will leave you speechless at the end."
"everything about this movie is outstanding. saw it a couple months ago (and rewatched today) and it never got out of my mind. easily the best movie of the year. one of the bests of the decade, or even of the century. Bong is extraordinary. the performances are legendary. the script, production, everything - it will leave u speechless. totally recommend. if it isn't nominated for best picture at the oscars i think imma go insane"
"okay but this is the BEST movie of 2019!!!! thank you bong joo, this movie is art"
"Claramente o melhor filme de 2019, at? ent?o. Uma obra de arte que trata sobre assuntos delicados sem parecer exagerada. Nos faz pensar e ver os detalhes. O roteiro e a dire??o de Bong Joon-ho est?o entre os melhores trabalhos que eu j? vi. Simplesmente incr?vel."
A film that finally satisfied me after many years. thank you Bong joon-ho. :)
"I dreaded watching this but I wanted to understand the feeding frenzy over this vulgar stupid movie. Each character was unattractive & unlikable in his (or her) own way. The plot was absurd. I can¡¯t think of anything that could¡¯ve made this boring meditation on sociopathy come to life The inexplicable, over-the-top violence is a substitute for character development. The characters are all the same. There¡¯s nothing positive to recommend wasting two perfectly good hours watching this disgusting sensationalism with neither message nor plot"
Just go for it absolutely best movie from South Korea every department goes well in this movie
Ye people may live in my walls too¡¦ Peak Content ??
"Really good. Would recommend. Good acting and kept me gussing. Ending was annoying. If the dad hadnt lost it they could have gotten away with it, pinning the murder of the wide and attack on the crazy husband."
"It started light and funny but turned so intense and shocking?I didn¡¯t see that ending coming. Smart, gripping, and it sticks in your head long after."
"Parasite is a brilliant psychological thriller that explores class disparity through the story of a poor family who deceitfully infiltrates a wealthy household. As their manipulation deepens, the film reveals both the absurdity and tragedy of blind trust and social inequality. With its unpredictable plot and morally grey characters, Parasite delivers a sharp, thought-provoking critique wrapped in dark humor and suspense. Read the full review here: (Indonesian version : alunauwie.com)"
"The movie is too generic, having nothing to offer. every event is predictable and that's all."
"Fantastic story, performances and cinematography. This movie was great and kept me glued to the screen and on my heels from start to finish."
"This is a work of Art not a movie, absolute masterpiece!! Engrossing, shocking, emotional and raw....a must watch."
Top 10 all time for me. I have never seen a movie so good like the parasite.
"Parasite is extremely engaging, has a great build-up to the chaos, and has 1 or 2 really shocking plot twists that seem possible in real life."
Absolute Cinema Bong never miss..
A Haiku Review: Heartbreaking portrait Of class struggle compromises Beautifully shot
Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
"An entertaining black comedy, yet with a less plausible plot, where a whole family just too easily goes from folding pizza boxes to completely taking over a wealthy household."
Not much to say its just good
"SPOILER ALERT I'll start by saying that this film is intelligently written. It was a hilarious black comedy and was well on its way to being a masterpiece in my eyes, and then came the final act. It went from black comedy to full dark tragedy with an ending that was all over the place. I'll admit, this picture is too well-made to not be considered a great film, but it deserved a proper ending. Something definitive. This ending just did not work for me. It was certainly strange, but not in a good way. It was not boring, I'll say that. It just lacked a proper resolution. In my humble opinion, this movie could have ended in a number of ways and still would have been a masterpiece, but the way it ended seemed more like a collage of unfinished ideas. No matter how I feel about the story's end, I most definitely recommend this one. 92/100"
I mean I¡¯m glad I watched it because at least I know I didn¡¯t miss out on anything.
Yeah this movie slaps right here
If you¡¯re going to watch any foreign movie this should be the one.
"I love this movie so much. I was so into it I literally forgot to breathe. Everything the vibe, the characters, the scenes, the lines just felt perfect."
"I genuinely have no idea why this movie is so popular. The acting is good, but the storyline and plot are boring. This movie is fuc*ing boring. What is wrong with people?"
Fantastic. This is a great movie.
"Parasita te fisga j? nos primeiros minutos e n?o larga at? o ?ltimo frame. Bong Joon-ho mistura com?dia e drama com maestria, mostrando a fam?lia Kim lutando por cada centavo enquanto cai de cara no universo luxuoso (e cego) da fam?lia Park. O contraste social ? exibido de forma afiada ? ora absurda, ora dolorosamente real ? sem cair em moralismo. A narrativa ? constru?da como um rel?gio su??o: cada detalhe aparentemente trivial no come?o volta com for?a total para amarrar o cl?max surpreendente. A sutileza das piadas, aliada ? tens?o crescente, transforma o filme numa montanha-russa emocional. E, por baixo de tudo, pulsa uma cr?tica social poderosa, que exp?e as fissuras da desigualdade sem so?obrar em discursos ?bvios. Com atua??es impec?veis, dire??o cir?rgica e um roteiro que equilibra tons sem titubear, Parasita n?o ? apenas entretenimento ? ? cinema feito para incomodar, divertir e deixar a gente pensando por muito tempo."
I¡¯m so glad they added that ending cause SPOILER ALERT I would not have been able to stand it if they ended the movie right at that garden scene
"Story is brilliantly woven, almost rhythmic like a sharp jazz drum solo. The film reveals that human flaws aren¡¯t born from wealth or poverty, but are magnified by both. A blend of style, substance, and unsettling truth. Fun as hell from start to finish."
Amazing and interesting all the way through.
Great movie with great acting and makes you feel on edge the whole time and is surprisingly tragic
"Really great film, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time."
"I believe Bong Joon Ho has become a master director. The first film he directed and that I saw was Parasite. I was blown away by his directing, the production, cinematography and acting. A S. Korean friend who also enjoys Parasite told me that the class differences, their style or ability to live is spot on. I have watched this film many times, and will watch it many more times in the future. It is in my personal top 10 foreign film list."
"I think about this film quite often,it is that good."
A cinematic masterpiece. It is perhaps the most perfectly-paced film of all-time. The story remains both compelling and elusive throughout. The plot is like a Russian nesting doll unfolding one twist after another. A truly perfect film.
"This movie was unexpectedly a masterpiece and also smartly funny and really well executed. I can¡¯t really say anything cause this movie is just straight up a masterpiece and a must watch experience. I recommend you this art, it will blow your mind"
I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Bong Joon Ho and Song Kang-Ho are AMAZING. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
Never does a home play a leading role like the architectural masterpiece in Parasite. A home doesn't make a family; only people can. Mental illness doesn't discriminate between socio-economic classes. This isn't a Disney movie; especially ending.
"I am baffled why this movie was given so much attention. I couldn't even get past the first 35 minutes which were very slow going. I had absolutely zero emotional investment in the characters. When I look at audience reviews on this and other platforms, they seem over-the-top to the extent that it makes me wonder who was paid off and how. Nothing against the actors or the direction. It's just that there are so much better films."
A very good film. I enjoyed every minute of it.
"This movie has such high ratings, but I tried streaming it twice and abandoned it twice."
An original masterpiece of storytelling. This was a super fun watch. Although it¡¯s in a different language than my own I enjoyed it greatly.
Great masterpiece ??
Great film. The last 25 minutes is astounding! Simply a masterpiece!
"The story builds so well that when the chaos finally hits, it feels earned and unforgettable."
One of the best movies ever produced.
"One of my favorite movies and I don¡¯t think recency bias will change that. It¡¯s just one of those stories that is super original, contains a lot of metaphors, and keeps you wondering what will happen next. I went in with zero context and loved it. Also saw this in black and white which was cool I guess? Saw it again at home in color and it was even better."
Good movie with great themes of classism. Definitely recommend. This is probably a career peak for the director
Best Foreign movie I have ever seen Bong Joon Ho did it again
"A superb film that makes you grateful for what you do have. You find yourself feeling the emotions the characters experience throughout and thinking about your life and where you can relate within the film. It's well written, beautifully acted and extremly thought provoking. Cinematography is excellent as well."
"Ok, I was skeptical that a foreign film won Best Movie Oscar? This movie= Weird, but in a super cool way, almost like a David Lynch type film. Ultimately it's a Very Sad movie. I've seen other Korean films and though they usually are ok- they don't compare to American movies, this one, just based on it's originality and story, deserves the 5 stars- I don't give many that. The acting was good and not too hokey which Korean acting can be at times. The dialogue was good, some of it funny, and it's nicely directed and shot. Korea is Now, what America will be in 50 years- poverty and suffering so a few people can have everything they want. I'm gonna ruminate over this today and it's obviously going to stay in my collection. Great Film."
Wish I could give it ten stars!
This movie proves that Bong Joon Ho is a GENIUS!
I ain¡¯t got much to say that hasn¡¯t been said already.
Watched it with my brother and we can't get over how good and gruesome it is in it's nature. A MUST WATCH.
This is what great Cinema looks like Phenomenal acting and direction and brilliant in all the technical aspects. But the storyline and underlying message make it a masterpiece
Black humor that comes with a dreary tension
Do yourself a favour and scroll past this movie. Total rubbish!
Incredibly good! Of my favorites of the last decade.
"great movie and story, got me hooked to the screen..."
Una obra de arte espectacular pel?cula me dej? sin palabras
One of the best films of the decade.
o sistema ? foda.
"The first Korean-language movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Success in 2 hours and 12 minutes!!!!!!!!!! LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The USA grossed over $53,700,000.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Loved that movie, I hadn't seen the trailer before and it was a complete surprise! Climax, direction, writing, everything is incredible!"
"Could have been enjoyable, if it wasn't so tragic"
"I watched this movie a few times now and keep on being amazed by the story line, production and the downfall of being greedy"
A beautiful film that brings you on a fun journey then leaves you stunned and introspective. My #1
Vaya obra maestra
"It's a bit overrated but 200K people seem to think this movie was the best movie of the 21st century. I've watched a lot of Korean revenge movies and this was probably not at the top. However for awards purposes I can see why it is ranked so high, Korean movies/shows were never really publicized until recently. Look at Squid Game, the reason it got global publicity was because of Netflix. Without Netflix it never would have gotten so much fame."
"All Time Classic. The editing and pacing are masterful. It reminds me of something that Hitchcock or even the Coen Brothers would make. It's extremely witty, has really good dark humor, and has tons of underlying commentary about poverty and a two class society and the different human expierence by each and how those worlds collide. It's an extremely intelligent thiller. The cinematography is first rate as well. The shots inside the house, deep focus, lighting, and direction are all just masterful. Everything else is really good. Never really seen something like this. Everyone should should give this a try once."
Just an incredible movie which shows the different lives between different households. 1 poor and 1 rich. And Bong Joon Ho's directing is just incredible. Deserved every Oscar it won.
"a great movie in every way, an even better plane movie. But don't get scared away by it being in a different language it still is a perfect movie."
"Totally deserves the 4 Oscar awards it has won. Took me a while before I finally saw it, masterpiece! Watch it without reading any more info about it. Dont watch the trailer. I didnt and it was full of surprises for me."
"Downloaded this on the plane, thought it would suck... Might be one of the best movies I've watched."
"Hey, I just wanted to give you a heads-up that this review might contain some spoilers for the movie ""Parasite."" The movie starts with the story of the main character's family. They live in a small basement room and aren't very healthy. They make a living by folding pizza boxes, which isn't a very well-paying job. Their financial struggles are so big that they turn to public insecticides, administered via wifi, and have to use them inshared spaces.Money problems also mean that they can't go to college.But then, the protagonist meets someone who helps him and his family move in with a rich person. His initial job as an English tutor, where he gained his teaching credentials, was followed by his rise to a professional position as an art instructor, a role that also required him to get his teaching credentials, since his sister, who was also his art instructor, didn't have much money.Despite the lack of financial resources, the hero's creativity and methods won over the mother and child.It's heartwarming to see how he found his way to become a loving art instructor. Then, the father allowed him to become a driver, which he did with a clever plan. The film is full of moments that shed light on classism, like when the rich mother hits the car seat with her foot or when the rich father pretends to smell the hero's father.There's also a conversation between the rich husband and wife about the driver's body odor, drug trafficking, and underwear in the car that looks insulted. It all builds up to a point where the hero's father feels so insulted that he has to stab the rich father to death. Thoughts from this movie In our world, people who don't have a lot of money often have to work really hard to take care of themselves. It's more important for them to think about themselves than to think about other people. Even when we plan everything life doesn't always go as we'd hoped, as the hero's father learned the hard way. It's important to see challenges as chances to grow, like when the hero decided to become a tutor in a rich family to boost his family's finances and used his cooking skills to help out. But, as we all know, being greedy can sometimes bring about our own downfall. And that's exactly what happened to the hero's family. Their greed and the actions that followed led to a heartbreaking outcome. Overall of this movie This movie is a really great example of how different people's lives can be. It shows how the lower class and the upper class live, and how they feel about each other. It's a really interesting story that keeps you hooked for almost two hours. It's not a story with a lot of characters, but each character has their own interesting story and history. There are also clues throughout the movie that you have to look out for."
Perfect from start to finish! It¡¯s been my favorite for years.
"Good movies, but NOT Best Picture great. The social commentaries are spot on, pacing is good, ending is phenomenal, however still lacks that quality of memorable from a great movie like dialogue, memorable characters and overall feeling left once seen."
"Very good film. It describes the different life style of the 2 families ver well. My only negatives are there are a couple of scenes which weren¡¯t needed as much, but overall, very good."
Parasite review I love this movie it¡¯s so funny and so messed up but kelp me entertained 5 star 10 out 10 star 100 out 100 star
"Engaging and conniving. The movie shoes that you need need explosions and CGI to tell a story that keeps you hooked. There's enough truth and caricaturizing in each character, so that everyone is important to the story. Don't spoil your first view by reading the plot or watching trailers. Just watch it and you'll be satisfied through and through."
"I thought this movie was brilliant. I'm not usually one for closed captions, but this one is well worth it!"
"There is one word and one word only that describes this film and its essence, and that word? ""Perfection"" is that word. I genuinely couldn't find ONE flaw in the film, from cinematography, to wide shots, acting, looks, side characters, this are very few movies that I can 100% say, is AMAZING and PERFECT, and this is one, you've done yourself a distaste by not watching this film"
Didn't make it 30 minutes they first 29 were so painfull. This might be the worst movie ever made. Completely unwatchable.
Incredible!! Defiantly recommend!!
Classic modern day cinematic roller-coaster. What a joy to ride.
"This movie has two experiences: that when watching & when remembering. For the first, I felt it's pace slow. But, like the title, it's impact grew within me and lingers still."
"Magnificent ! A film that does what very few modern films seem to be able to do: make a highly entertaining film where the social messaging is apparent but it doesn¡¯t overwhelm the rest of the experience. Edgy, dark, funny and devastating."
Perfect Film!!! Simply a Masterpiece!!!!
"Brilliant and razor-sharp social critique disguised as a thriller, balancing dark humor, tension, and drama with absolute mastery. Gripping story that exposes class struggles in a way that feels both universal and deeply unsettling. The film constantly shifts tones and keeps you on edge, making its message hit even harder. In a few words, it¡¯s a cinematic masterpiece that sticks with you long after the credits roll."
It was ok. A bit overhyped IMO. I didn't find any of the characters particularly relatable or likable. The Host was a much more entertaining film by Bong.
"Great acting, movie was super interesting. Thought the scheming and the characters felt realistic. Was interesting to see a different world dynamic struggle between the poor and the rich. Top 5 of my movies this year and I wish I had seen it sooner."
I have seen this movie so many times and I never get bored of it. I absolutely recommend it!
"A wild story where you find yourself rooting for the villainous underdog. Parasite showcases the divide of classes in South Korea, which is familiar worldwide. Beautifully shot film with lots of heart, suspense, thrills and laughs."
Bong Joon Ho is quite brilliant. It¡¯s the class levels that are becoming the greatest divider of society. Wealth doesn¡¯t insure dignity and class.
This masterpiece about social classes was so intense in the IMAX theater!
All time greatest! Had all the feels...literally all the feels
love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.
"I believe it is wonderful how the director is able to transform a seemingly normal beggining into a tenseful film that catches your attention fully. I also must applause the form the movie uses ""unharmful"" scenes to do so, in a way that, little by little, you understand the feeling of complete tiredoom from the poorer family. Absolutily unsettling and extraordinarius!"
"Third act was rough, just like every Osgood Perkins movie, but this one has something the others don't, which is incredibly gory deaths and impeccable comedic timing."
"I was advised to watch this without learning anything about it, that's what I did, no summary, no trailers. I only knew it won Best Picture so my expectations were high. Unfortunately I was let down big time. I expect to care about characters, I did not care about these. There was no one to root for, no hero, no attachment at all. It was like watching your neighbor's life that you couldn't care less about, drag on and on, until you realize in this case, that the twist and resolution was not meaningful either, as if the writer needed a conclusion and asked around for the most ridiculous ideas, then simply chose one and wrote it in. One review characterized this film as ""vapid"" and I fully agree. A good movie will at least move me emotionally in some way. This didn't do that either."
Uma loucura de bom. Me surpreendeu o desfecho. Simplesmente amei.
Loved it the first 4 times I originally saw it in the theater. ow eve better in IMAX. Keep re-releasing great films like this and I will show up at the theater every week!
A family of con artists. Filled with twists. An all-time favorite. ¡°Does dripping his sperm on my seat turn him on?¡±
JUST GO SEE IT IN IMAX
"Parasite is the perfect entry way into foreign film. I watched it for the first time during my second year of college. Since Parasite, I have been released into a new world of artistic cinema. The captivating use of lighting, environmental framing, and metaphorical ark makes Parasite critical to the dedicated audience."
"Third time watching this film. Incredible. Thrilling, thoughtful, meticulous. Love it."
"This movie was amazing, I think you should watch it if you like thrillers that reflect on society and has something new at every turn"
Bong Joon-ho knocked it out of the park with this one. Seeing it in IMAX was especially powerful. Highly recommend.
Boring and stupid. Waste of time.
One of the best films of the decade.
"A good example of fiction that inspires introspection, shows social commentary, but also doesn't skimp on dynamic entertainment. In a sea of movies that go through the social media fame and come out the other side as overrated, Parasite sustains its worth."
"It¡¯s a compartmentalized concept, somehow expanded to be grander than it needs to be, but it works¡¦ and I¡¯m not really sure why."
"indeed capitalism made us parasite in some way. love the plot it's actually a crazy one, cinematography and screenplay is amazing truly deserved the Oscar win for International Film Feature and Best Picture! please produce more films like this one, love it sm!"
"In the year 2019 it has been a very busy year for films that actually have a seal of approval of films I've watched at that year. Some of which I haven't reviewed apart from three of them such as Little Women, The Gentlemen, Joker, The Irishman, Marriage Story, Uncut Gems, Toy Story 4, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum and Avengers: Endgame, now we have a film which is a foreign film that many people including myself really, really love and we'll cherish it forever in years to come and that foreign film is got to be Parasite. Yes, Parasite, one of most anticipated films of all time and one of the memorable ones out there. Many people had difficulty watching it without knowing what they're saying but the subtitles can help them understand and since that this is another foreign film I reviewed I think I should be doing more if I had the chance. The Kim family lives in a semi-basement flat (banjiha) in Seoul, have low-income jobs, and struggle for money as they're all unemployed. Min-hyuk, a family friend, gives the family a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that the Kims' son, Ki-woo, lie about his education to take over his job as an English language tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the rich but na?ve Park family. After his sister Ki-jung helps create a false certificate for him in Photoshop, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student, is hired by the Parks. Moments later, Kim's family takes peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks for their livelihood until something goes wrong. What makes this film so great is the its masterful blend of social commentary, suspenseful storytelling, complex characters, exceptional cinematography, and a tightly woven plot that explores the stark realities of class inequality, all delivered with a unique blend of dark humor and thrilling twists, making it a thought-provoking and engaging cinematic experience for viewers from diverse backgrounds. I'll be very honest here, it's not for me doing this review. There are millions of people who actually and giving it highest 5 star or 10/10 making it a much more worthy film even for a foreign film like there are many foreign films that really deserve more praise and never overlook them as a miss and this one is not because it's been loved by so many who love it even this film is on the list of films in Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Metacritic, even Letterboxd and I've been thinking: ""Is there any of me doing this review?"" and I know what's done has to be done just like I have to do a lot of movies I'll be doing next time, many which that are great and some of them are bad I have to rant to make you laugh. Like this movie here which is darkly comical unexpectedly. Even if you can understand the ending and everything about this film is immense. With many words to describe this movie, you know exactly what I mean so with that said, Parasite is one of the best films and best foreign films of 2019."
"There are just a few directors that have accomplished such a complex and unique combination of feelings, genres and twists, all of these in one movie. Bong Joon-ho did it, and he did it great. It's a movie about capitalism. About that intrinsic sense of belonging and owning, in societies so different, but so alike at the same time. The chemistry and behavior between the characters and their ""plans"" will keep you on the edge of your seat. You will ask yourself through the whole movie, who is the ""parasite"" of the story. A closer look at a family living in some unfortunate conditions and the contrast with the upper class, and how far will they go to have whatever (they think) they need to be happy."
??? ?? ?? ??? 70% ??????
A masterful movie in every way
"The ending is effective but I'm not sure it says much, other than that the disparities between rich and poor are senseless; that they breed mutual enmity out of resentment and indignation, or a sense of effete, supercillious perogative. It's layered, sure. It's also well executed; and in it's own way incisive. But honestly, I don't think it's ultimately saying anything a reasonably intelligent person, with enough life experience hasn't figured out for themselves already. Or maybe I've just been poor for too long? Are you stinking rich? Well, good for you! Watch Parasite. Or don't, no one will care, least of all you, either way. Are you poor? Well, you probably won't be overly impressed. Are you middle-class? Well, no one cares for your opinions of this film, excepting other middle class folk of course. So have at it!"
Parasite isn't the grand treatise on class disparity that people have made it out to be. But it's a great thriller that's just ridiculous enough to keep from being too depressing.
"An amazing dark comedy thriller that seamlessly blends clever satire and dreadful tension about class divide and how it forces otherwise good people into a fight for survival by any means necessary. Despite the subtitles, I was so engrossed by the almost-hypnotic visual storytelling, the easily relatable identifiable performances, and the page-turner narrative that constantly keeps you on your toes with not knowing where the story's going yet continuously building upon itself with amazingly brisk pacing despite its 2+ hour runtime. I love how there's so many layers to the themes and even who's the real titular ""parasite"" given all the individual actions vs the root systematic cause of their actions. It's also just genuinely hilarious despite the dark turn it takes. But even that dark turn feels naturally woven into the narrative without feeling like cheap scares for shock value. It's an amazing cinematic experience and easily one of my favorite movies of 2019."
Parasite is one of the best movies ever created. A true masterpiece!!!!
"An amazing movie full of twists, turns, never ending surprises, this was a movie I didn't know much about (other than the shortest of summaries and the fact it won the Oscar for best picture). It exceeded all expectations for me."
"Bursting with ideas and a complete hodgepodge of genres that all come together quite brilliantly, this is a rare film indeed and a thrill ride to boot."
"Nothing to add, a modern masterpiece."
One of the worst films I've seen. Should really be renamed Parashi*e.
The best movie I ever seen in my life
"Challenging social comentary and reflection on social pressures on individuals/families. Wonderful tension in the story and between the characters. Some big moments, with expert presentation and handling. It isn't just entertaining, it is edifying and challenging."
Good and thought-provoking movie? Yes. Number 1 on endless lists and worthy of an Oscar? Not in my opinion.

"Incredible at making you uncomfortable, and plot was great"
You will fall in love with Korean cinema
"Solo a un cinefilo puede parecerle una obra maestra, porque es el mismo tipo de personas que le fascina ver una pila de baldes con arena caerse. Para colmo un tipo escribe: ""La mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos"", seguro es la unica pelicula que vio."
"This film is pure genius. There is nothing imperfect about this movie. It is funny, thrilling, dramatic, and satirical all at once in the best possible way. This movie has so much to say about the way that we think about and treat others and presents these thoughts through and interesting plot, genius dialogue, and amazing acting. This movie is the perfect length and is a constant thrill ride that never really slows down. The ending is amazing and satisfies the viewer in all ways. I am thrilled to see more films by Bong Joon-Ho and am especially excited for Mickey 17 this spring."
Eu fiquei pensando em um roteiro t?o simples que ganhou v?rios pr?mios.
The greatest movie of all time
"Don't get me wrong, this was a great movie but was it the best movie I've seen in years? I wouldn't go that far. Still, the acting was amazing. The cinematography was stellar. The story was great but it wasn't necessarily mind blowing."
"Most overrated and overhyped film I've seen in forever. And I was SO up for this film. LITERALLY every other film that was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars that this was up against were better than this. It shouldn't have even been nominated! And yes, I DID 'get it' AND understand it, it was still terrible."
Nice casting. Coming with a story that will depict what the society is ideed.
"Everyone raves about this movie. I mean YA, I GET IT, ITS GOOD. I just didn't like the way it made me feel. You know? I felt like I was anxious and like I was cringing the whole movie. Maybe it's just because I watched it by myself, but I don't know. Still giving it 3 stars, and you can kick rocks if this rating pisses you off."
"It's a nice and high-quality movie to watch. I really liked the course of events, but there were some boring scenes, but I think it's a quality movie with a good progression. It's worth watching."
This is a once in a lifetime masterpiece. It deserves all of the oscars it¡¯s won and so much more. This film is etched into my memory forever as a work of art.
Incredible film from start to finish. Combines genres and delivers tension without sacrificing a gripping story. Deserves all the accolades and more.
"I just finished watching the Film. The first thing I need to say, shouldn't be about the film itself but rather about the feelings within me right after it. I am sure many of you might know the painful feeling of emptiness, one might experience if ones favorite Series, with characters and a Story, you had the chance to bond to over an extensive amount of time and many episodes and seasons, comes to an end. You just feel without a clear goal. It feels like a good friend has died (ok maybe not that bad) and you need to learn what to do with yourself again after having got used to spending all your time with him/her. This was the first movie, that made me feel this way. You might say, that feeling like this might sound like a terrible thing, and in some way it is. But if I personally deeply think about it I would object. This feeling is a wonderful testiment of how great a movie was able to touch the viewers emotion and soul. In a weird philosophical way it is proof of the true humanity of everybody that feels it. I dont think this movies brilliance can be boiled down or be dissected in individual parts like cinematography, characters or story. It is the great sum of all those parts that creates the true brilliance, being the feelings it awakens in its viewers. It perfectly mirrors an each and every humans being in a way. This is why you might feel a rush of those described negative emotions. But if you think about it and feel really deep within yourself...It also awakens the feeling of being understood and a part of a greater, loneliness-expelling community of beings that are in some or another way connected by interest or emotion and therefore possess the ability to archieve wonderful and amazing feats... ...such as creating this movie"
"A masterful blend of dark humor and social commentary, delivered a thrilling narrative with unexpected twists."
"As entertaining as it may be, the ending meets the viewer's expectations."
"This Movie was intense! Beautifully filmed and well-depicted lessons on greed from many perspectives. You can see the tarantinoesc way about this film, but ultimately, this film was its own thing. The framing and the simplicity of dialogue and vision were powerful. Though the violence and this type of intensity sometimes aren't my favorite still, this movie had such awe about it it made sense that it got a movie of the year! It drew you in. For me, there's no need to see it twice, but glad I saw it once."
Absolute masterpiece
"Really good movie! Beautiful cinematography too. I did not like that much some of the events at the end, but still good."

Temas sociais que permeiam a classe m?dia e alta da Coreia do Sul s?o o foco desse drama premiado pela academia com quatro Oscares.
A great movie indeed!
"Stunning, captivating, comedic yet real, raw. Incredible piece."
"Bong Joon Ho is really one of the best directors right now. Parasite, even with this insane ending, it's still so human. what an amazing movie."
An extraordinarily ugly film. The fact that it's done so well only adds to the disgust of it all.
Really good movie.The plot might be confusing unless you look up videos online
The OG eat the rich. The crown jewel of the sub-genre.
"I don¡¯t get the exaggerated hype. Sure, this is one unpredictable plot with great cinematography and performances, sprinkled with an entrancing soundtrack. That makes it far from perfect nonetheless. The first part is tedious and seems elongated, while the second part is not that different, except for a slightly-rushed infamous scene. As a whole, Parasite is peculiar but also somewhat pretentious, and this has nothing to do with the portrayal of a snobbish bunch, but rather with the way through which this snobby-needy juxtaposition is dealt with. In a world of extremes where the ratings for this movie are either 5 stars or just half a star, I choose to take the rocky path, and declare the following: this isn¡¯t a movie one would find oneself itching to watch again any time soon, but it also isn¡¯t one short of standing beside the classics."
Hated this boring movie. I should have been warned when the critics like something.
"Watched this without any knowledge of what it was about on an airplane. I knew it was a contender for best film a few years ago but didn't know anything more. I was pretty entertained and shocked in a good way by the film. It was pretty stressful at times, but a good movie makes you feel things! Would recommend."
"Parasite is a hands-down masterpiece. Cinematography, acting, atmosphere and plot are flawless; it is pure fun from beginning to end."
No wonder this film won an oscar it's amazing.
"Best movie I've seen in 2024. By far. Checks every box for a great film - character development, plot twists, script, acting, and an incredible story arc. A must see indeed."
Great movie. Very metaphorical.
"Its sad sometimes seeing the diferences between the people who has a lot of money an the people tha don¡¯t. This movie explore that feeling and how that feeling of being diferent is slowly grown up and becoming angry, violence."
Dark comedy. That ending. RIP.
"Parasite offers a disturbing analysis of current social disparities, delving deeply into the complexities of modern capitalism. The movie presents a meticulously structured narrative and uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate the tensions of a divided society. As an engaging class warfare thriller, Bong Joon-ho not only critiques the system but does so in a provocative and original way, avoiding didacticism. The result is a cinematic experience that challenges and intrigues, providing deep satisfaction and lasting reflection."
One of the best foreign films you could ever watch.
"""Parasite"" transita por g?neros, de maneira genial e visceral. Com uma bela constru??o narrativa, que aos poucos vai criando suas consequ?ncias, causando o espectador ficar instigado com a trama genial composta por Bong Joon-ho."
"One of the best movies of all time. Absolutely S tier. If you liked this one, I urge you to watch Oldboy."
This movie is art as well as entertainment
"parasite is definitely my favorite movie in the world. the choice of the character it¡¯s literally perfect ! and the social criticism of the film is also very well elaborated, when you discover the meaning of the ""bad smell"" and the ""divider line"" the film gets absolutely better ! but I just can't accept the end of ki-jung ¡¦"
"Amazing cinematoraphy, story, and writing."
Easily one of the best movies in all of the 2020s
"A fantastic and thrilling watch. After watching it once with my father, we sat again mere months later to rewatch, and it was 100% worth it! The movie is extremely gritty and smart, comedy is perfectly timed and I grew to fell in love with the characters. Not a moment of screentime is wasted, and it definitely deserves more recognition. A fantastic ending, a fantastic movie. Kept me hooked the whole way through!"
"It was like an almodovar movie, but korean. Not really the masterpiece the Oscars sold to the world"
esse eh um dos maiores ne
An astounding take and look at classism
"Bong Joon Ho creates a spectacular film with comedy, and drama appearing throughout the film."
"Masterful in a fashion rarely seen in many movies, 'Parasite' is the only film I know where I couldn't imagine it without the wild tonal change."
Next......not a good movie
Parasite is a visual masterpiece.
"For me this movie did not live up to the hype. How were the Parks, the rich upperclass family, responsible for any of the madness that ensues when they come into contact with despicable Kims? The critics think that this film brilliantly explores the nuances between opposite social classes. I think it was all just rather vapid and pointless."
"Glad to see a foreign film get nominated and win (even though they have their own category). I¡¯m fairly familiar with Korean drama, but for the virgin Kdrama viewer this may have seemed cheesy. I enjoyed the film, aside from that slight cheesiness that is common in Korean film/television. It was darker that typical Korean fare, and the ending was bizarre. This wouldn¡¯t have been my pick for best picture. Too many other great choices this year."
9.1/10 That's it. That's my entire review.
"Even though I like to watch Korean movies, there's a few I like a lot, with this one I didn't clicked at all. It seemed like I've seen it all before. OK, I get the point but its nothing close to groundbreaking and certainly not worth of all the praise it got."
just Awesome. The plot the characters the theme. Its uniqueness
"Great film, would describe as a dramatic psychological thriller. The characters and character dynamics really shine in this film and you end up feeling for both families."
Wonderful and interesting
"It was a bit strange, but despite this was very interesting, pretty uncomfortable and inspiration giving. Also I am not a fan of Korean movies, I may have misunderstood some ideas, don't know."
"Not dubbed, never going to officially be dubbed. I stopped watching subbed media a long time ago, I dont want to miss any detail in the background or expression on a face. For that reason, the director's choice, the film is unwatchable."
"Perfection in narrative, performance, and direction? Parasite will eat you alive."
"I started watching thinking it would be boring, but it surprised me! Great movie! In the end, I applauded by myself."
Complex ideas crafted to perfection!
"I understand the movie refers to the social gap. I really do. But for someone who's already aware of this, the plot makes much ado about nothing? Sure there's a little suspense with the basement, but that's about it. I truly did not see the hype on this movie, as a movie buff as well. I watched it in all subtitles, but I don't think that's what killed the experience for me. The plot felt, nonsensical, or rather, inconsequential. The script didn't have any standouts. The character relationships or other character tropes weren't anything special. The only interesting point was seeing how rich people, aren't really aware of their riches, or how other people might look at them / strive to be like them. Is that truly indicative of a bigger scale or just a piece of these characters, who knows."
Outstanding. The pinnacle of dark humour with a few philosophical moments. A must-see.
"Filme tocante, com v?rias cr?ticas sociais, mostrando como o capitalismo esmaga as pessoas que n?o conseguem ter renda alta, e que por suas necessidades acabam cometendo infra??es. Vale a pena demais assistir a esse longa, indispens?vel nos dias atuais."
"Parasita ? um cl?ssico instant?neo, o melhor filme do s?culo 21 e um dos melhores de todos os tempos!"
"Bong's masterful writing and direction is evident in this magnum opus clashing entertainment, intrigue, thrill, criticism in our society, and leaving you emotionally hollowed."
"Didn't expect it to have this kind of plot, but still a good movie"
"""Parasite"" stands as a cinematic tour de force, a searing indictment of the socioeconomic disparities entrenched within Korean society. Director Bong Joon-ho masterfully crafts a narrative that pulsates with tension, expertly weaving together themes of class struggle and human desperation. The film's chaotic energy is palpable from start to finish, ensnaring viewers in its gripping tale of deceit and survival. At its core, ""Parasite"" presents a scathing critique of the cavernous divide between the haves and the have-nots, as the destitute Kim family infiltrates the affluent Park household through a web of deception. Each twist and turn in the plot serves to intensify the film's relentless momentum, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats as they grapple with the moral ambiguities laid bare before them. What truly sets ""Parasite"" apart is its ability to provoke introspection long after the credits have rolled. The film's rich tapestry of characters and layered narrative demand multiple viewings, each unveiling new depths to explore and dissect. Bong Joon-ho's directorial prowess shines brightly, infusing every frame with a sense of urgency and unease that lingers in the mind. In the end, ""Parasite"" transcends the confines of its genre, emerging as a profound meditation on the human condition and the corrosive effects of inequality. It is a cinematic experience that demands to be rewatched, its impact only deepening with each subsequent viewing. In a landscape inundated with mediocrity, ""Parasite"" stands as a beacon of artistic excellence?a film that will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on cinema for years to come."
"pretty good movie, not my kind of thing but i still liked it"
I love everything about this movie. Definitely my number 1 favorite film of all time.
"Mid. This movie has bland characters that are just archetypes for the story which in itself is quite basic, tragically. I'm certain that if this movie was made in the US, the acclaim would have been lower than it is now. There are better classism stories out there, this ain't it."
"This is a heavy story, with conflicting people all over the spectrum of the society. It's a hard mirror for us to look, and an amazing movie."
"I watched this with my son Beebert. He was traumatized and did not understand anything because I had it in Korean because I know Korean but he doesn't and has to learn. Beebert was not enthused by the amount of social commentary in this movie, and left to go watch Wild Kratts. That does not matter, I am the only one that matters."
One of the best films I've seen in my life.
"A masterfully crafted film that expertly blends genres, seamlessly transitioning between comedy, drama, and thriller elements. Bong Joon Ho's direction is superb, as he skilfully builds tension and suspense while also infusing the narrative with biting social commentary."
I love it when movies are this original and fun to watch! It came apart a little bit in the end though.
"The consagration for a great filmmaker, getting the worldwide recognition he deserved after a series of magnificent work; even taking home 4 Oscars for himself with this, one of the greatest non-english language movies of the 21st Century, if not of all-time."
"Super boring, I wasn't even paying attention until the ending and every part of the movie was very clear to me, so simple and a boring dialogues"
"An immaculately crafted and riveting tale of class divide told with an interesting story, strong performances, and beautiful cinematography."
"It's the best movie, It shows how the class gap can bring a person to the border of madness and how much our words can affect the life of others"
"The first 80 minutes is a boring drawn out predictable track of over explaining the rational to fire everyone. The metaphors are ham fisted. These movies about people being people start to suck after awhile when you deal with people being people 5 days a week. It's a social satire great, it's not saying anything that hasn't already got me down in the past."
"There's nothing about <i>Parasite</i> that hasn't already been said, it truly is an amazing piece of work and deserves all the praise it gets. Plenty of other films have expressed the same social criticisms, but it's the exploration of human desperation with extreme authenticity and realism that is so haunting. It's disturbing, yet brilliant, and is what really makes <i>Parasite</i> standout, it exposes the inequalities between social classes, and how it brings out the worst in everyone."
Inesperado. Diferente. Filme surpreendente.
Pretentious weebs like to overstate how good it is.
"It begins with a family of four from the lower class in Korean society: a father, mother, eldest son, and younger sister. Both parents are unemployed, and the children did not continue their education. They all lived in a basement room, but then suddenly it was like heaven had given a big blessing to this family. When the eldest brother's friend has to study abroad, So he entrusted him to teach English to a rich man's daughter. However, this apparent stroke of luck eventually leads to unforeseen disaster. And this is the first movie in 92 years of the Oscars to be the winner of this award. It is a non-English-language film. It's undeniable this movie is famous and popularity because of the outstanding cinematography and unforgettable characters. First of all, I will talk about the best scenes that impressed and fascinated me while watching this movie. The scene of walking down the stairs to return to the Mouse Hole home while it rains occurs after the Parasitic family has to escape from the paradise they have only recently enjoyed. The Kim family ran home to save as much of their belongings as possible. After watching that scene made me feel like it reflects society that rich people are at a high point and can take the heart of a crisis, but poor people must overcome their own obstacles. Then, during the conversation with the lady during a phone call, she talked about something that made Kim Ki Taek stop. This is another scene that makes me feel that no matter what class or society you belong to, you will be criticized, looked down on, oppressed, and cynical by someone higher than you anyway. While all the actors in the film deserve praise for their performances, Kim Ki Taek's character, portrayed by Song Kang Ho stands out of the narrative. I really love him because, he is the main characters that makes the story fun, hilarious, tense, and thrilling at the same time. He made the story colorful and not too stressful. I agree that some characters may detract from the main plot. Therefore, time doesn't seem fluid and it takes time to watch it several times to understand that point. Transitioning to the architectural symbolism employed by the creator. The stark class divide is clearly expressed in the design of the Park family's home It has a raised entrance and clearly delineated glass edges. This suggests that the production is highlighting socio-economic differences. To reinforce the main issue of inequality. Moving on to the movie's overall impact, I enjoyed with many emotions and perspectives, but the things that make this movie win so many awards and praise are the analysis and solving of each case and the clear satire of life. If anyone likes this kind of movie, it's certainly one worth watching."
"Una obra maestra. Cinco estrellas totales. Una pel?cula sensacional, bastante argentina en varios aspectos."
"The gold standard of what every ""eat the rich"" satire wants to be"
"This movie was the best i ever wathced in my life, from story telling to camera shots. Just one thing, the movie ending would be more intresting if the son from poor family when he got hit by the rock, developed some pshihological problems and top that there was kinda lack of conflic bethen poor family dauther and his ""studient"""
Very deep and refreshingly original. Loved it.
I ABSOLUTOOTLY LOVE IT
Melhor filme que j? foi feito j? hist?ria da humanidade! At? os dias de hoje.
"Although vastly overrated, ±â»ýÃæ starts with a very creative idea, supported by lovable performances. Unfortunately, it soon falls apart due to the Korean adagium that some super unrealistic thing absolutely MUST happen to keep a movie from being boring, and as soon as the film takes that turn, there's really nowhere for it to go but an uninspired conclusion."
"The acting in this movie is acceptable and we accept all the characters, but in terms of structure, narrative, mise-en-sc?ne and framing, this movie is very good. I think the director knows what he wants and knows how to show it, and this is the art of directing."
The peaches had a significant role in the details of the movie
Great storytelling! One of my faves..
This film was genius and it deserved all the awards it received.
"After you watch this film, ask yourself who the titular parasite is! As a lower-class family integrates themselves with an upper class family, the lies and deceit begin to bite them back as they discover something that throws everything into disarray. Bringing up themes of class and high society, this is a film that'll leave you shocked and very unnerved!"
"A pretty good movie. Though I think it's a little overrated. The story is interesting, the chacters on the other side are rather one-dimensional and boring."
"O filme me surpreendeu pq fui esperando um grande filme que ganhou 4 Oscars, e o filme n?o me agradou como o esperado. N?o achei o filme ruim e sim n?o foi o que eu esperava, esperava mesmo um grande filme e as mensagens desse filme s?o muito boa, que s?o o que me fez gostar deste filme. O final n?o foi t?o bom e o que o filme entrega no come?o a metade do filme, criei tanta esperan?a com esse filme que foi o que me fez n?o da a nota m?xima."
This movie is different in its own way. The movie takes a complete turn and takes the audience for a wild ride of awes and shocks. Great symbolism and realism.
"Great movie, great actors no doubt, a weird end."
"Une p?pite cor?enne. Un excellent moment pass? pendant le visionnage. Un film ? voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du probl?me des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'?tre, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine tr?s bien et ne se pr?cipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
Demands to be seen with as little advanced knowledge as possible because this will allow you fully appreciate how gradually Bong Joon Ho moves the plot from farce to something else.
Social-class opener! We All know that social class is prevalent in society but this movie shows how unaware the upper class is to the Lower classes and the struggles they face or how irrelevant it is to them unless it directly affects them.
Decent movie the story was good but the plot was predictable. some odd scenes that felt unbelievable. not sure why its a 99 or got so much praise. movie is soo mid
"""Parasite"" is a film where every element serves a specific purpose, contributing to its status as a true artwork and masterpiece. Bong Joon-ho's directorial prowess, and outstanding performances from the cast, make ""Parasite"" a film that transcends the boundaries of its genre, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema?a true film masterpiece."
"Excellent, very clever, a bit different and thoroughly enjoyable"
Amazing cast. Thoroughly enjoyable and powerful. I didn't quite get the meaning behind the ending but still liked this movie very much.
"So good, there are a lot of hiddens beside it"
one of the best movies of this decade. hands down. will rewatch an infinite amount of times
"This film is absolutely thrilling, engaging, and contains elements that will grip you throughout its entirety. However, I think there are far better movies from South Korea that I myself have seen recently such as ""A moment to remember,"" & ""Past lives."" They might not be of the same genre, but the previously stated films, mainly ""A moment to remember,"" deserves to be equally acclaimed of not more. Despite lacking thrilling aspects, which most of the time is what forces us to be glued on our sofa expecting every upcoming moments, these movies rely on romance, interesting stories, and subtly reveal concepts that we rarely stumble upon on most movies and series being released these days. The actors are impeccably competent, the excellency of the cinematography is unimaginable, and the sets display visually appealing areas of the Asian continent. This is an area that I think ""Parasite"" must have capitalized on. Gladly, they saved the whole thing with twists and turns, mainly one that makes the 2h12 worth your time."
"Saw this in the theater when it came out and then saw it again two days ago. Excellent portrait of rich and poor and, as always with Korean cinema, the innate flaws of humanity and pitfalls of an infinitely imperfect universe. Sometimes the morally superior position is unoccupied because, given the tools the characters have been assigned in life, the morally superior position is exceedingly difficult to compute and/or attain."
"The movie Parasite directed by Bong Joon-ho was released on October 11, 2019. This movie started Lee Sun-kyun, Park So-dam, and Choi Woo-Shink. The movie starts off with a poor family living in a home in Seoul. They manage to work for a rich family and soon get to enjoy the rich life status once their bosses leave. The movie takes a turn and involves science that some may consider violent. As the poor family is at the rich families home, the poor families home gets flooded. Kim Ki-woo, the son of the poor family is trying to get his family out of their poorness and just wants to be apreciated by them so he tries everything he can to get them a wealthier life. SPOILER: During the flood he reaches for the rock which his family thought was worthless while Kim Ki-woo knew it had value. He saves the rock and gets out the home. Overall This movie is entertaining but may be confusing fro some."
"""It keeps clinging to me"" Parasite will be remembered for generations. Every frame is a painting and, despite its harrowing depiction of the damages of classism, a shared struggle emerges which is, simply put, human. Anyway, fun stuff!"
"Parasite, dark and satirical, reflects society's corruption in class struggle. The films follow a struggling family, the Kims, and their climb to fortune through working for a wealthy family, the Parks. Bong Joon-ho et al.'s fastidious composition of every frame, consistent symbolism, and contrasting color grading leave no doubt as to how Parasite garnered the 2020 Academy Awards for Best Picture, and several other nominations and wins. The film's ending, fresh and unexpected, never felt out of place as the subtleties of carefully placed details throughout the film foreshadow the ending's twist. The gifted stone, speculated to bring wealth, only brought corruption and misfortune; The bright red sauce splashed onto pizza foreshadowed the fatal consequences of the schemes crafted; The line that must never be crossed- except when one character does, all subconsciously produced the perfect atmosphere of the foreboding implication of something terrible to come. The contrast of the darkness of the Kim's downstairs world to the Park's airy, bright, and naturally lit atmosphere forces the audience to reflect on their interpretation of class. As we watch the endings of each character, we have to wonder if they got what they deserved. How we feel about them forces us to confront our values- to many, this led to the feeling of discomfort and that the film was too 'odd'. The constant artificial lighting and dark grading of the downstairs world remind us of the Kim's goals to worm their way up in search of light. As Joon-ho's morally gray characters climb up the stairs or driveway, they reflect the inherent societal desires for wealth and the strive to achieve it. Joon-ho uses separate upstairs and downstairs worlds to supplement the film's message rather than to become the premise of it. This allows a fresher and freer interpretation of class struggle rather than recycling through past examples of this familiar piece of symbolism for class struggle. The character's journey of climbing up becomes another one of the film's several subtleties. (ESHS Film Club- Yumna Khan, Jonah Gardiner, Stevon, Sonia C)"
Excellent. It really deserves the Oskar.
just the scene after the flood is sufficient for this movie to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
"Parasita ? um filme que brinca com o p?blico ao construir um enredo bem desenhado e din?mico, e surpreende o telespectador com o resultado das a??es dos personagens. Super indico"
100 % of tomatoes with all the profound abyss of mankind; best film of 2019
"In my opinion, a great movie needs: -to keep you entertained with a gripping, original story -interesting, well-rounded characters that develop over the course of the movie -to be thought-provoking, and stay with you long after you've watched it Parasite delivers on all points, in spades."
"This film deserves a five star review, firstly because it criticizes social inequality, and secondly because it does it in an impeccable cinematic way."
Amazing movie. Genius. So well made. Tells a great story. I wanna rewatch.
"So kids, the lesson today is when a family member asks you to help them invade someone's life, leech off of their success, and eventually get them killed by a deranged old man, you say ""no, why would you do that?"""
"Sadique, palpitant, thrillant, parfait. Du d?but ? la fin, ce film est un chef-d'oeuvre."
"Masterfully directed. The tone is so distinct and special, and the acting is superb. Human, charming, tense."
I just enjoy the first part of it Then the plot went weird and I didn't like it I really don't know how it gets 90% as score
"The best movie of all time in my eyes. The cinematography is so astounding that you need to watch it again just to appreciate fully it's brilliance, as there's alot you may miss on first viewing."
"Amazing, visual art, story, lighting, camera walk¡¦.. everything is perfect. It show the line of top and bottom peoples in every way in movie."
"Quelle twist, le film est incroyable du d?but jusqu'? la fin un sans faute"
"A Rorschach test of sorts that discerns your place on the class spectrum, it's a clever, slick, and thought-provoking piece."
Fantastic movie. It Felt as if it was a perfect film.
"""Parasite"" is wild. It's perhaps the most wild film I've ever seen. The story is compelling. (And there really are two or three stories in the film.) It's also really imaginative. However, at times, it's just not enjoyable. Even if you like genres under which the film falls."
Great movie. I can assure you the parasite does not include the mind virus that plagues the west.
"Parasite is definitely a ""must see"" film in 2019, and is often regarded as Bong Joon-ho's most influential masterpiece of a black-comedy, who also directed the acclaimed films such as Snowpiercer, Okja, Memories of Murder, and The Host, and the first Korean film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. This plot centers about the unemployed destitute Kim clan who pretend to be highly-qualified individuals by infiltrating the wealthy Park family.."
"Un chef d'oeuvre qui a prit du temps ? murir en moi, mais vraiment aujourd'hui je ne peux m'emp?cher de le comparer ? tous les autres films, qui me semblent ?tre de la m?me veine."
Genuinely amazing story with deep economic meanings yet scary and disturbing.
"Incredibly smart and detailed screenwriting and direction. The build up is a ride that keeps getting higher and higher until it eventually starts to drop into chilling thrills and it delivers more than expected. Well crafted climaxes. It feels pretty insane and dramatic, but it still knows how to be humourous. The cinematography and music is fantastic and highlights the storytelling very well, while the cast is brilliant and convincing on their part during the whole act. The editing is very clever and engaging. The use and timing of the slow motion dramatizes scenes just perfect. The script is flawless. The sets compliment the narrative and create a great contrasts between the two families. The flooding scene looked pretty good, including the explosive toilet. There's seemingly no scene that feels out of place. Nothing in this movie went to waste. A masterpiece."
One of my all-time favorites. The first movie I paid to see a second time.
I've never seen a movie like this. Awesome
A truly perfect film. Great themes about social classes while also being entertaining throughout.
"This movie is so good holy, I ve never seen anything like it, and its good. Its got a lot of soul, the performances are amazing, the shots are extreordinary, the pacing is nearing perfection, I dont know what else to say, i m amazed. Wow. Big ups"
This move is a masterpiece!!!
I disagree with most of the film's premise but find it hilarious and affecting all the same - would be nice if modern audiences could understand that this is very achievable. Not everything has to be us vs them.
"One of the first real/serious films of Hollywood I watched. It's the one and only movie that always comes to mind when someone asks ""What are your 10 top movies?"". Do not even bother reading reviews, watch it and see for yourself."
"One of the most unique, thrilling, suspenseful, bone-chilling, edge-of-your-seat movies in not just this decade. but of all time."
I did not love it but I liked it very much
One of the Best Films of All Time.
I liked it but didn¡¯t love it. I thought the story was interesting but not that exciting. It was fun to watch the family work together but it wasn¡¯t my favorite. Not a best picture imo
A fresh and original story that moves along at a steady and well-balanced pace with more than a couple surprises along the way.
"This is s very good movie. What makes it so is it presents very complex relationships in a simplified, limited sets environment. There is an intimacy to the proceedings, and this augments the comedic aspect as well. The acting is efficient and effective. The one drawback is the two dimensional characters; presented as absolute versions of rich and poor. In other words, you're either on this side or that side. That is not to say that there are not people that act and think this way. It all seems very convenient and you can predict character reactions. There is no warmth or sympathy between the families. No personal connections, with everyone being disposable and blind to one another. They pursue their own self interests without ethics or morality. Either a hustler or very gullible. However, as a black comedy this can work and it does so throughout the movie. It is a movie that must be thought about, considering each layer like Matryoshka Dolls. Class interactions causing intra-class dichotomies and violence. A very harsh movie on its own characters. I have watched it more than once. I pick up something new or a new idea about the film with each viewing. Exactly the effect a thinking movie should have on its audience."
"One of the best movies ever. It's just perfect. Not much needs to be but perfect plot, acting, characters, shots, directing, just everything. It was a truly enjoyable and unforgettable experience and is a film that everyone should definitely watch."
"A great original story, solid acting, and shocking twists and turns make Parasite a highly entertaining movie. Easily weaving in its themes of class inequality, Parasite makes for a thought-provoking drama while still being interesting to watch."
An absolutely fantastic film with a great unique original story that is only held back from perfection because I wanted the family to continue to get away with what they were getting away with.
"A clever, original story that intertwines drama, comedy and thriller elements brilliantly along with a heavy dose of social commentary."
Interesant pana accelereaza tamp spre final
It kept getting better and better.
Best Korean movie of all time.
"The first half of the film is darkly humorous, with a family living in a basement lying and framing the driver and housekeeper in an effort to work for the rich. When I saw the first half, I thought it was supposed to be a comedy. Until they see rich people go camping, but the Jin family actually live in the mansion, eat and drink, and completely consider themselves rich. It makes me uncomfortable to see this because it is ""greed"". They want to make money. That's normal. But to enjoy a life of utter hypocrisy is ""greed"". Seeing the heavy rain, I thought the host family would come back. The good part of the movie is the return of the old butler. The turning point of the film is the scene leading to the basement. From this moment on, this is no longer a comedy. It became a conspiracy, a bigger lie, a fight for life. I thought that the Jin family has parasitic in the rich family, did not think that the old housekeeper and her husband is a bigger parasite. After watching this movie, I always wonder what I would have done if I was living in a basement, working for a rich man. I will definitely work hard to make money, change a better house, and then through this job to find a better job for myself. That should be most people's plan. The Jin family, although very smart, also very good at work. But they are lazy, do not make progress, do not have a plan, and do not seek to change the status quo. So they would rather be parasites and feel inferior than change the status quo. The lesson of this film is that if you are not satisfied with your life, you must find a way to improve the quality of your life, because you can!"
"It was entertaining but not mind-blowingly good as many western critics indicated. Part of the confusion is caused by western critics who seem to be evaluating the plot's shock value based on a European/western 3-act structure instead of the 4-act Asian structure. This movie plot follows the latter and is consistent with the timing and expected twists and turns of that structure. After accounting for the 4-act structure, this plot is not as shocking or surprising as western critics seem to think. Instead, it takes the expected twists & turns in the expected order, which reduces its shock value. Still, it's an entertaining way to pass a few hours."
"Parasite is unique, funny, relentless, nerve racking and deeply earnest. The juxtaposing themes and visual staging unveils a climax that will leave the audience shocked and thrilled."
Hard to watch. Seems to be glorifying class warfare. Not good
"GG Bong Joon-Ho, please direct my life"
"Bit too dark for my taste but deserving of best picture in the oscars great movie all around a must see, so good!"
"Hilarious, genius, heartbreaking."
This movie is absolutly masterpiece
One word. Wonderful!
One of the best movies I've ever seen. You cannot miss this one.
"Good, but overrated. Didn't deserve best picture, Jo Jo Rabbit was better"
Well it's Oscar nominated so that means it's sht. So average that you want to scream. Don't pay money for it but watch it so you can say you did.
Trump brought me here. Im not into reading subtitles but have no regrets watching this well deserved Oscar worthy
"It's good, but I do not know if I like it. Not sure how I feel about this, it's very simbolic and has something to say and it's an incredible thing but I don't dig it, don't know how to explain it too."
"Overrated is the operative word. This is a year that gave us Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 1917, JoJo Rabbit, all of which I believe were far stronger accomplishments. Regardless of that, this is a good film, at times very good, but there's nothing that merits the hoopla other than a foreign film being the the esoteric darling of that year's Hollywood cultural mentality about cultural mentalities. Parasite isn't worth vaccinating against, but its overactive accolades were a bit pestilential."
"Awesome. There are no good guys or bad guys. Everyone is equally Parasite & equally Host. Quite brilliant on nearly every level from story to humor to thriller elements to acting to cinematic craft. I didn't expect to like this movie, yet once it was finished exclaimed, ""that might be the best movie I've ever seen."" Do not go into it with those type of expectations & avoid knowing too much about it beforehand. It's great movie & one of my favorites."
This is an intense movie. It's almost like 2 genres in one.
Best picture? Good grief. Bleh.
"Hands down, one of my top 5 movies of all time."
Cathartic! Totally recommend it!
"In a world of cgi superhero rubbish, this stands out as one of the best films of modern cinema"
"If any creation is able to make an unforgettable imprint of what needs changing in this world, that production has fully achieved it's purpose. Through precise acting by the cast the movie imposingly justifies the desperation of the neglected. A well written story with imaginativeness of the highest quality. Excellent visual effects and use of colour tones to portray the decaying of the society's core. Excellent design of characters capturing many traits of personalities. There's alot to gather from this movie and what's truly interesting when it's viewers turn to decide who the real parasites of the society are."
"If you're one of those spectators that do not have any problem reading the subtitles, you'd find out a well acted, crafted, edited, movie with a surprise twist worth of the academy award."
"It was OK. Not too interesting, the whole movie I was waiting for something to happen"
I thought this movie was fantastic. A human story of class tragedy and horror.
"A masterpiece in filmmaking. Parasite is a thrill ride, never revealing where it's truly going until the bitter, pulse-pounding end."
Probably going down as a classic
I can't even explain
"Loved every aspect of this movie, appreciate that the story is well-written and has a solid premise. You can tell that a lot of work went into making this film. Both the acting and the cinematography were excellent.  Contains many lovely symbolisms and touches on issues such as wealth and inequality. There is just so much about this movie that I enjoy."
"Great film and story with amazing shots! Also, one of the best endings I've ever seen!"
Watched this in theaters great from start to end
"When I first viewed ""Parasite"" I thought it to be wildly overrated. But upon my second viewing I absorb the storyline much better. Maybe I was in a better frame of mine. Parasite joins my top 10 movies of the 21st century, along with ""Children of Men,"" ""The Two Towers,"" ""Judas and the Black Messiah,"" ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" ""Casino Royale,"" ""The Incredibles."" ""Carol,"" ""Get Out,"" and ""Don't Look Up."" ""Soul"" moved to number 11."
"The director of the film knows what he is doing. In addition to addressing social issues, he manages to create really important characters and an ingenious and simply amazing plot, which leaves the viewer more and more suffocated and involved in the story. The film is perfect, in my opinion."
"The best movie ever made, especially internationally! With the best acting ever by an ensemble! Plus, the best directing from Joon-ho Bong! Also, the best movie screenplay ever written! As well as the best editing ever done in a movie! And the best production design ever made in a movie!"
"With a brilliant mix of genres, Parasite manages to touch, surprise, frighten and chuckle with flawless acting, immaculate cinematography and a deeply enthralling story that honors its audience proving Bong Joon-ho's masterful command in the art of filmmaking."
"This is one of my favorite movies and I'm often hard to impress. Today, I watched this movie and had no idea what to expect. It was a twisted, hilarious masterpiece of cinema. It had my heart beating. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Anyone who's a movie geek like me has to watch this."
"A tedious mediocrity for a so called ""masterpiece"", Parasite is one of those movies you go into expecting a walk on the red carpet experience especially for a Critic Apprentice like me none of over sort happened and snacks were not provided so I had to begrudgingly hark over $20 for a popcorn. Surely this couldn't get any worse but as the light went dim and the projector starting whirling I stared in pure baffling awe as the movie wasn't even in English no seriously who would have left such a grave technical error in the final product. I had to squint and read the tiny text at the bottom surely damped my mood. This movie was only made to hate on rich people which is insensitive because they are only using the fruits of their labor to live their everyday lives. I find it Ironic that these ""top critics"" shower this movie with praise when they themselves are money hungry worms, how upsetting.,"
A breathtaking and different film from South Korean cinema about the class gap...
"La trama es interesante, muy disfrutable, la escenograf?a perfecta, buenas fotograf?as, actuaci?n excelente. Aunque el final se siente un poco sobre expuesto y apresurado."
"Director Bong Joon Ho has always been preoccupied with socioeconomic disparity, but he takes it to an entirely different level with Parasite. When the impoverished Kim family cleverly inserts itself into the wealthy Park family, life for both families spirals out of control, resulting in unimaginable chaos and horror. Parasite is a film truly unlike any other, an ingeniously plotted nightmare that works as both an art film and entertainment for the masses. Bong Joon Ho, a master of visuals, frames and blocks every shot meticulously. Humor is perfectly balanced with suspense, all while remaining faithful to his theme. Parasite is one of the best films of the 21st century, if not the best."
"Tenso e intrigante, o filme me surpreendeu. super recomendo"
Um dos melhores filmes de todos os tempos.
One of the most original movie I¡¯ve seen in a long time. The Oscar was well deserved
This movie was entertaining through out and kept me engaged from beginning to end. My favorite Bong Jooh-ho film and in my opinion his best to date. It still has its faults and seems a bit preachy at times but I still really liked/enjoyed the movie.
a very good but not absolutely incredible movie. uses symbolism the most very well. very good storytelling through visuals
"Among movies that will be in the running for the Oscars 2020, the most interesting is the achievement of Korean director Bong Joon-Hu, not because of some special quality and originality, but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics. Please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of Korean films, nor was he ever interested in being one. On the other hand, Bong Joon-Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013, so the criteria should be in line with that fact. The film is at first indisputably interesting to watch, drinkable, extraordinarily driven. It is placed between comedy, drama and thriller, intelligently refusing to classify itself, as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems, avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder, so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible. It will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars, except for acting, because there is no reason for that. But there is also no reason to emphasize the over-originality of the story itself, ie. screenplay, because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement's ""Joy House"" (aka ""The Cage of Love"") with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda. The main thrust of Joon-Hu's film is taken from the title, with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere, which of course is so modern today, but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis, for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons. Also, in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot, communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre. Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before (just remember the ""contribution"" in directing of the 2015 award-winning plagiarism ""The Revenant""), there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year."
"shocking to see so many korean actors in a korean film of course, where's your diversity ? The film was very good with interesting social commentary, but I did find it a little absurd in places and the ending wasn't for me"
"This is a tense and somewhat unsettling film, which is thrilling and claustrophobic at times. Its certainly a multi-layered plot that builds up slowly. I wouldn't want to say anymore so as not to provide any potential spoilers. Its not clear from the start what's going to happen and it's a film that's likely enjoyed more if you don't have too many pre-conceptions. Its certainly quite a memorable film. I wouldn't say it's the most thought provoking film I've ever seen by any means but it is pretty thoughtful, in terms of the general societal themes covered. I would certainly recommend it if your keen on world cinema and like to watch films that keep you guessing."
"Der Film ist eine Mischung von Schauspiel, Thriller, Gleichnis, Posse, Karikatur und Kom?die. Und spielt das soziale Ungleichgewicht in S?d-Korea und sogleich der Welt an. Bong Joon-ho schrieb das Drehbuch mit Han Jin-won, und sogleich f?hrte auch Bong Joon-ho die Regie. Der Film ist perfekt inszeniert, er ist mit sp?rbarer Liebe ausgestattet, und mit K?nnen gestaltet. Selbst die Filmmusik ist mit Modernen und Klassischen Elementen best?ckt. F?r mich ist der Film mit seinen Darstellern in aller Hinsicht Perfekt und des Lobes w?rdig, ein Genuss f?r die Augen und f?r die Ohren."
"Filme legal pra caralho, gostei de como a fam?lia conseguiu os empregos com a fam?lia rica, e gostei do mini plot twist no final do filme, s? achei o ruim a garota de morrido com uma facada s?, e o garoto ter ficado vivo por causa da pedrada na cabe?a, mas acho que a garota era para ficar viva no filme. Mas de resto, eu recomendo muito esse filme, vale a pena assistir, mas n?o sei se merecia o Oscar."
One of the best movies I¡¯ve ever seen.
"A haunting pitch black comedy that thoroughly skewers the dog eat dog world of capitalism. It leaves you feeling lost in the fog of who the real parasite is: the poor who must violently contend against each other and fight dirty for a chance to suckle off the teat of the rich, or the rich who are infantilized by their own wealth into a selfish helplessness on which they survive off the labors of those they keep in destitution. The twists kept me on the edge of my seat, while the dark humor rubbed salt in my wounds. All of this brings you to an ending so bleak, it highlights the faults in a system where the only way to live is without direction, as any plan is folly in the face of where you are born under capitalism."
"Parasite is like a Boeing 777 taking off vertically, soaring high, losing velocity, and falling to earth in a raging fireball. In other words, I've seldom been so impressed by the first 3 acts of a movie, or so let down by the last 2. What makes the movie initially so charming is the crisp, fairy-tale structure of the plot, offering glimmers of hope that maybe, just maybe, filmmakers have rediscovered the art of storytelling. The Kim family's takeover of a palatial hillside home, or at least the downstairs bit, is a joy to behold. It follows relentless patterns of connivance and insinuation, as when the old housekeeper is let go for seeming to stain a handkerchief with tubercular blood. No problem: Mrs. Kim, with a helpful reference from a daughter posing as an ""art therapist,"" is right on hand to fill the spot. Despite the folktale vibe, there's plenty of nuance too. We are not invited to simply pity the destitute Kims or to despise the complacent Parks. Somewhere midway through, Mr. Kim shares his life's store of wisdom with his son: planning things out is a waste of time, and whatever happens, happens. What can you do? With such a patriarch, it's not hard to see how the Kims have made themselves desperately poor. Equally reprehensible is the Kims' outlook toward the Parks, whom they dehumanize as gullible marks. Meanwhile, the Parks are presented as clean, organized, and essentially decent. Mrs. Park, despite her emotional imbalance, is particularly winsome, and you flinch when the Kims call her an idiot behind her back. Unfortunately, all of this nuance is lost by the end. Other reviews have pointed out the richly metaphorical nature of the movie, but I would add that the metaphors fall like a rain of bricks. In seeing Mr. Kim, hired as a chauffeur, forced to don an Indian headdress for a birthday party, we are to associate him with the oppressed peoples of the world. In seeing his neighborhood flooded with sewage after heavy rains, we are to understand that the very structure of the world keeps him wallowing in filth. And when, while Mrs. Park is driven on a lengthy shopping tour, we see her feet stretched toward the front seat alongside Mr. Kim's face, we are to gather that he is at the family's mercy. This kind of ham-fistedness reveals the severe limits of socialist comprehension; it cannot really get at the human condition. When the story ends in a bloodbath, you know it's gone off the rails in a bad way. It's not merely the loss of structure or the conflation of genres that bothers me; it's the draining of expansiveness and humanity."
"The direction, the cinematography and the visual messages in general are just incredible well-done. The story is perfectly constructed, making this both a really dynamic and deep film."
"WOW! Easily one of the best films I've ever seen. A must watch. Its a comedy, drama, and thriller all roled into one. Amazing story telling and character development. If you haven't seen it, cancel your plans and watch it tonight."
"good drama, lot's of symbolism, witch i love."
A movie that glorifies stealing from and killing of honest folks. It worries me that this sad ultra-left fetish received such high praise.
"The overall high level of quality is very apparent, the movie is excellently staged, shot and directed. The story also moves at a very efficient pace, it's fast but every scene adds to the story, and it slows down when it needs to. Parasite is truly gripping, partially due to its structure, and it uses both humor, and tension expertly. The films message is clearly conveyed, not only through the characters and their actions, but also very much through the cinematography. There are some nice dichotomies that separate rich and poor ? light and dark, clean and dirty, and high and low."
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT PLOT TWIST
"8.4 - Seamless transitions from light hearted comedy to tragic, real moments. Great use of metaphor but not my best picture of the year"
"Parasite is one of the few movies you will find where I don't have a single critique to give. From start to finish the experience keeps you hooked with an innovative plot that was acted perfectly by the cast. It's well deserving of its acclaim and deserves your attention for one sitting, without a doubt one of the best films, not just of 2019, but to ever be created. Bravo Bong Joon Ho, bravo"
"5.0/10 ? ""Poor""/""Inferior""/""Amateurish"" -(Seen on 7/10/22)"
"La pel?cula perfecta para cerrar la d?cada. Esta joya de suspenso y comedia negra surcoreana dirigida por el casi visionario Bong Joon-ho, es m?s que solo la mejor pel?cula de 2019, es un fen?meno sensacional de la industria. Saltando de un g?nero al otro, ""Parasite"" (2019) realmente sorprende con su inteligente humor, reflexi?n ante los temas de interacciones y clases sociales, y d?ndole una vuelta de tuerca a la trama un par de veces. Las emociones de la pel?cula adoptan nuevos grados de intensidad por minuto (el pulso cardiaco tambi?n), apoyando todos los g?neros que representa, as? como paralelamente los temas preocupantes que hay en su escena. Sus numerosas nominaciones a los ?scar aseguran su t?tulo como futuro cl?sico, principalmente por el logro de ser la primera pel?cula de idioma no ingles que gana el premio a Mejor Pel?cula. Este es un tipo bienvenido de par?sito que no se va de mi cabeza, y creo que muchas personas que la vieron van a estar de acuerdo al respecto."
"I sat down to watch this movie with my dad, who has poor eyesight, can't read subtitles very quickly, and usually falls asleep halfway through movies. He was riveted throughout the whole movie. The plot is so satisfying and suspenseful. The climax was upsetting and really made me think. There is so much to analyze about this movie. The ending was so perfect too."
"With a brilliant mix of genres, Parasite manages to touch, surprise, frighten and chuckle with flawless acting, immaculate cinematography and a deeply enthralling story that honors its audience proving Bong Joon-ho's masterful command in the art of filmmaking."
"This is a mediocre movie. I didn't enjoy it at all?it was just weird. Not funny, and not satisfying. Very violent. Worst Best Picture winner I have ever seen by far."
"""Parasite"" captures you from start to finish. It's engaging, thought-provoking with its premise, captivating with its performances and music score, and somehow manages to handle the tones of humour, drama, mystery, thriller suspense without them conflicting, all wrapped into one film. One of the best of the decade, and a well-deserved Oscar win."
"What an interesting movie. I don't really know what to think of it, to be honest, that's why I gave it a 2.5 out of 5. It had an interesting plot at the beginning with them all taking over the house but it began to get gruesome and weird towards the end. The ending was just crazy. I don't know if I would recommend this movie or if it is as great as everyone makes it out to be."
A masterwork in storytelling and shifting tones.
I don't often disagree with Mark Kermode but I found this a big disappointment.
One of my favorite non-English films with witty writing and amazing performances. Story is great as well.
simplesmente o melhor filme do ano dele.
My favorite movie out there for sure. It has great pacing with an exciting genre combination and always keeps the audience on its toes with great symbolism and relevant themes.
"Amazing portrayal of how human evilness manifests differently between social classes - while still featuring a riveting plot. Blends humor, suspense, and dark moments super well and transfers well to an American audience. Definitely deserved Best Picture."
One of the best movies ever created
"Outstanding Cinema. This is a much watch. It has all the ingredients of a classic film ? humor, sadness, excitement, despair and hope. I'm not sure exactly who is the parasite though since the story does a great job of not turning any of its characters into a villain. Does a great job of displaying the contrast between abject poverty and extreme wealth and how classism plays out and ends in tragedy."
A brilliant film! Truly a masterpiece.
"When I finished Parasite, I called my best friend. ""Have you seen this movie??"" I asked, to which he replied, ""No"". ""You NEED to see this movie"" I urged. There isn't much more to say. If you still haven't seen Parasite, you NEED to see it."
"Amazing thriller, it will make you think what would happen next throughout the entire film and will still make you wonder what might have happened next even after film ends."
"Full of surprises, humor, and social commentary, it ultimately ends with deep pathos. Nothing is what it seems, and it ends up being even more so. It seems fairly light and what will turn out to be more a caper than what it becomes, which is a hammer over the head. A very impressive film that will keep you thinking long after it's over. Deeply affecting."
Best movie in a long time.
"through dark humor, the film describes the incredible misery it can mean to be human. the rich are deviant from reality and the others are excluded from reality. the end shows that the hope of being human just like everyone else never disappears."
"I loved this movie, it is one of my favorites. It is a movie with many metaphors, clear examples of social stratification, very interesting plots that will leave you amazed, very good cinematography and direction. A movie that has tributes and deserves them, if you are not a big fan of Asian cinema, I recommend this movie and I hope you like it :)"
Absolutely phenomenal! I don¡¯t usually like Best Picture winners or foreign movies (because of reading subtitles)¡¦this movie is one of the best I¡¯ve ever seen! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
"So f*cking good, must watch!"
"Parasite is a visually and emotionally stunning experience like no other film and undeniably meets all the criteria in order to be called a masterpiece. Having won many awards at the 92nd Academy Awards like Best International Feature Film, this movie is an absolute gem because of its acting, cinematography, and its relatability. Based in Korea the greatest deceitful scheme yet of the Kim family begins to unravel in many unexpecting ways that leave the audience stunned. Parasite offers a wide range of talented actors that advanced the story overall, creating such believable families. The cinematography is award-winning that helps support the main theme through the use of its unbelievable camera angles and lighting. Its ability to relate to the audience is what truly grants this film a must-watch alongside its technical aspects. It's an insightful look into the universal idea of inequality among different classes of people that generally affects everyone globally. All these fundamental elements artfully woven together give the impression of an entirely new movie experience, which makes it stand above the rest."
"This is one of the worst moves I have ever seen. It's boring, and the premise is ridiculous. I read a whole bunch of reviews to try to find out what I was missing. The reviews made no sense. This is an example of a movie people think they're supposed to like so they do."
Nothing attractive about anyone in this movie
"NUNCA UM FILME COM TANTO DEFEITO, UMA MERDA, UM MONTE DE XING LING JUNTO N TEM COMO FICAR BOM, SEM A?AO, SEM LUTA E SANGUE, FICAR TRES HORAS OUVINDO CHANFRRFFMVOEM, SIMPLEMENTE O PIOR FILME Q EU JA VI."
"Not only that Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite delivered in terms of telling a very well crafted story and theme, it also delivers compelling characters that were well performed by its cast."
One of the greatest movies of all time. Beautiful all the way through
"Eu ainda preciso encontrar as palavras pra redigir melhor, por?m, esse ? o meu estilo de filmes Thriller."
"Oh terrific! Thank you so much for making me depressed! That's just what I wanted in a movie. I'm sure I was the last person on Earth to watch this movie, but if there's another out there reading this: skip this terribly sad movie and be thankful you never had to realize how terrible our planet is."
This movie is brilliant. I don't even know what to say.
"Absolute bs, don't know what all the fuss is about."
"Very much hyped up in my opinion, few thrilling moments but it was hard to understand some of the character choices"
"Pi?kny, niepokoj?cy, bardzo wci?gaj?cy, tre?ciwy, smutny. Zako?czenie w po©©owie super, w po©©owie ca©©kiem z dupy"
"Entertaining *dark* scatterbrain comedy, that goes off waaay into the weeds at the 3/4 mark. Works, makes sense - you root for the Kim's - until the bizarre events of toward the end. Those choices seem somewhat contrived, and out of character for characters that have repeatedly demonstrated themselves as bright, and capable of 'passing for hardworking smarter-than-everyone-else competent people', for extended periods of time to get and keep their target jobs. Truthfully though, this dichotomy does create a substantial mismatch with the early depiction of them as substantially lazy, intoxicated underachievers, that can't consistently even fold boxes with any consistency, who suddenly and miraculously pull 'smart choices', and super-spy-level skills and talents out of seeming 'nowhere'. I think it misses somewhat in the 'capitalism is the problem' angle, widely pitched, as the Kims are clearly very capable and motivated, and can achieve amazing things, when they apply themselves, but seem to have arrived at their semi-basement apartment - and their lifestyle of sitting around folding pizza boxes - through utter lack of motivation and rampant inertia. Recommended, just not as satisfying as I'd hoped."
"Its triumph at the Oscars didn't surprise me that much: this movie is simply amazing! You have to watch it at different times in order to get all its cryptic messages. Plot, storytelling, screenplay, shots, and dialogues need to be deeply studied. A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating: 10/10"
"Superbly developed storytelling with real edge of the seat tension and unexpected plot turns. It's a long film, but the time flies by as you are drawn in to this masterpiece. Don't miss it!"
Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch!
"It's no wonder this film won Best Film of the Year. It is quite honestly one of the most perfect movies I've ever seen. Three very defined acts with three very different purposes. The third act is easily the most entrancing 30-45 minutes of a film I've ever seen. Things begin to change, and they change quickly. I'm not trying to say too much because I don't want to spoil ANYTHING Parasite has the greatest ending I've ever seen in a film. And that's genuine. Seriously, no words. This review has taken so long to write and this is all I got. MUST. SEE. FILM."
Disturbing but brilliant
"It was shot well, but it didn't have a good story or ending. I wouldn't want to watch it again. It also could have been a lot shorter."
Very good! Even if you don't care for whatever message about inequality the movie may or may not have.
"Entertaining and touches on some interesting themes, but the tone shifts wildly throughout the movie and elements of the plot make no sense."
"Parasite was a wonder to behold. The movie contained wonderful cinematography throughout, from glorious, smooth, long shots, to excellent handheld work. The film's superb visual architecture and design conveyed layers of meaning, accentuated by an incredible cast. And ultimately, though what Parasite has to say might not be anything new, it conveys it's story of class divide in a superb manner. In the end though, what stood out above all, was the sheer attention to detail. 99/100"
"This is a very accomplished, unique piece of cinema. I did not expect to like it as much as I did."
"I didn't like this movie that much, but the ending is totally brilliant"
"I loved the first half! it really captured me and wow is the photography brilliant. However I didn't like the second half as much, it got a bit too dark and it made me feel bad."
La mejor pel?cula que he visto en mi vida!! Todo es excelente!!
"Absolutely apallingly bad. One of only three movies I was unable to watch to the end, I was so boredIi had to walk away and had to pick up where I left off several days later. It's hard to decide upon which area lets this movie down the most, directing, acting, writing or cinematography, they all vie for the title. Low brow, hackneyed and predictable, this was just awful."
Best movie of all time
"Thrill knows no language. My stomach was in a knot the entire film from start to finish, from the dark comedic beginning to its masterful pivot into horror and suspense at the midpoint. Parasite is a masterpiece and well-deserving of its status as Best Picture."
Unique and out of the box.
"As brilliant a film on my fifth viewing as it was on my first. Unforgettable, unique and well deserving of the praise and awards it has received since it premiered at Cannes over 2 years ago. Don't let subtitles influence your decision to skip this film: you will regret it."
This Movie was Wild. I am usually not a fan of subtitles but this movie was fantastic. if you are up for a mind game that is somehow relatable and realistic. with a Tarantino twist and ode with a gruesome ending to the movie- simply leaves you with your jaw dropped. Wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. with the right kind of suspense and curiosity this movie was solid! would recommend.
"Parasite deserves its awards. It's unique, refreshing and innovative. It is well-paced and well-acted. It would make you laugh with its witty plot and dialogues. At the same time, it will shock you with some grueling scenes. A brilliantly executed con movie. It's the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Oscars, so it's bound to inspire and encourage more film makers around the world."
"a solid film with amazing cinematography! The actors were beyond exceptional and the story's plot moves from comedy to thriller, and underneath all the excitement, the film highlights important messages about society, class, and the human experience. For more check out my WordPress blog! https://wordpress.com/posts/expressourworld.wordpress.com"
"Disturbing. That's the first word that comes to mind. I appreciate disturbing movies when they teach me something or make me reflect but honestly I don't get why so much fuss about this one. I see the point about it highlighting the inequalities between rich and poor people and the fact that poor people would go to some length to improve their status but I didn't find that there was anything deeper than that. Perhaps some of the images slightly symbolical, ie. poor people living in the basement below the rich and the family's dad killing a bug (ie. 'parasite') at the start, but that's the easiest kind of symbols one can come up with. I totally don't get the fuss. What am I missing?"
"Bong Joon-ho keeps stepping up his game with every movie he directs: The Host (2006), Snowpiercer (2013), Okja (2017). And now the Palme d'Or winning movie: Parasite (2019). This movie contains wonderful pacing. It is a slow cooker with an explosive face-off in the final act. The humor scattered throughout the story is a perfect way to ease the tension before the characters cannot stand it anymore."
Oscar-winning Korean thriller which subtly but sharply critiques the societal class divide between rich and poor. Worthy Oscar winner that is thrilling and funny at the same time without losing face.
It's really that good.
"Fan f***ing tastic. It was very slow and I found myself wanting it to end, but the final 20 minutes paid off superbly. I definitely think it's worth the Oscar; it delivers a powerful message in an original way. Point docked for American Indigenous stereotyping :/"
An absolute original in every sense of the word!
"Summary: Ki-woo's parents are unemployed and trying to make ends meet. After his friend refers him to an affluent family seeking a tutor, Ki-woo tells a white lie about his qualifications and lands the job. Pretty soon, his family members are conveniently landing jobs as well! Takeaways: A unique thriller that left my heart racing, but for different reasons than most films. Fascinating characters + white lies = eerie fates. P.S. Don't let the Korean language dissuade you. Reading the subtitles doesn't take away the suspense or strangeness of the film."
Strange little movie but enjoyable. Well acted .
"It takes the orignal plot and turns it on it's head, and I loved the way it worked giving a great message and keeping us engaged."
"amazingly metaphorical, top tier cinematography, top tier acting, literally life changing, probably one of the best movies of all time"
The best Korean movie.
"South Korea has an answer for M. Night Shyamalan. That answer is Bong Joon-ho. Bong Joon-ho and his masterpiece Parasite has so much nuance moments in the film especially with the tone shifts. What I loved the most about the tone shift in this film was when the doorbell rang, the main characters get into deeper trouble then they thought with a hint of a twist. The music is beautiful, the writing is brilliant, and the intense scenes during the climax are just miraculous. Parasite is such an extraordinary that will be talked about for years to come."
Didn't really udnerstand the ending or why the father did what he did. Odd movie.
"Too little can be added to talk about this film, so I'll just reaffirm what we've heard millions of times: ""Parasite"" is a masterpiece wih no comparison."
"Warning: SPOILERS It's possible that I watched this movie with my expectations too high. The way most critics wrote about this movie I was literally expecting something mind blowing. Well¡¦ it was¡¦good. The first hour or so was really barely okay. This involved the poor family infiltrating the rich family by taking over the servants' jobs. Honestly, I normally wouldn't have made it through that first hour, but surely SOMETHING mind blowing was coming right? Well, not really. The rest of the movie was quite gripping at times. I really felt for the father of the poor family when he murdered the father of the rich family. That was Avery powerful scene. So add up a barely mediocre first half with a really good, but not great second half, and.., I don't get it? Is there something I'm missing here?"
"Brilliant, amazing premise and execution, incredible immersive direction, cinematography, and editing. One of my favourite movies for this decade."
10/10 If there was ever gonna be a perfect movie this is definitely in that conversation.
"The movie offered an insight to the class divide that exists throughout society within South Korea, although it could be applied to the U.S as well. The conflict between the rich and the poor culminate into a dramatic climax that leaves one wondering how two different worlds can coexist."
Pretty disturbing¡¦ and funny¡¦ kept me on the edge of my seat.
"Pure genius in story, directing, and pacing. Shifts between tones seamlessly and completely captivates the viewer during and after its runtime. It¡¯s message is poignantly told, and let¡¯s the viewer interpret its meaning without slapping you over the head with it. A masterpiece."
Hands down the best movie of the year. I wish I could see it for the first time every month.
"While it was good, I didn't find it incredible enough to win the Academy Award. The last half hour or so was uninteresting and a drag."
"Excelente pel?cula, una cinta totalmente merecedora ganadora de todos los premios que recibi?. No estaba seguro de qu? esperar, pero la trama, los giros, la reflexi?n ante los temas de interacci?n entre clases sociales, la fotograf?a, su mensaje final, la direcci?n, las actuaciones; todo es excelente. Tambi?n tiene algunos toques de humor muy bien implementados. En conjunto toda la pel?cula es muy entretenida por lo que es muy f?cil de ver y no te vas a aburrir para nada. Me gusta que es original y mezcla varios g?neros diferentes. No entra en ning?n molde, si bien hace gui?os a pel?culas cl?sicas, me parece muy original. En conclusi?n, una excelente pel?cula que creo yo todos deber?an ver porque es genial y su final te termina impactando. Muy recomendada."
"The movie itself is terrible. The story is terrible and doesn't make sense. But the main thing is it's not a movie, it's an artistic piece detailing the separation between the rich and the poor."
THIS MOVIE IS A MASTERPIECE !!!!!
Beautifully layered story about the horrors of our de facto class system.
"Good movie. Love to see that Korean movies are becoming mainstream. Little boring sometimes, but overall is pretty good."
Masterpiece. A must-watch for any film connoisseur.
"Revisiting this movie after Squid Game. While the two have no relation, I can't help but pair them together. They both reflect the harsh reality of social hierarchy, loan sharks, financial instability, and the filthy rich. Combinations which, as we see in both Parasite and Squid Game, lead to utter chaos."
A masterpiece of original filmmaking.
"Best movie of 2019 and the best Non-English movie ever made. Even though it can be hard to focus on the subtitles and the movie at the same time, it never fails to serve one of the best cinematic experiences ever."
"A very accurate depiction of the wealth gap that is relatable anywhere you go in the world. It shows how desperate people become for money and the small, subtle messages throughout the film make the movie even more exciting to watch."
a really good movie and bcuz of it i start watching some korean movies
"Fantastic. Definitely a different feel from most movies I've seen. Worth the watch and the insight into the social commentary. I had a very different perception of this movie when I saw its poster. It definitely turns dark very quickly at the end, but then has a nice yet eerie resolution in the end. Would recommend if you enjoy film and something different."
"Parasite movie is outstanding. It has many levels, great detail and a fresh, even harsh look at the rich-poor divide in the world today. Some scenes evoke Tarantino's signature, but it is made in the best tradition of Japanese movie art. You cannot stop to think about this film even next day. Every body must see it and think about our wrong world where one part lives in prosperity and the other part struggles restlessly to survive."
"Since it received the 2020 Best Picture Academy award, I felt compelled to watch the film despite the fact that it was sub-titled with no English overdub or Audio Description. Too bad I hadn't taken more than a couple of semesters of French in high school, since they did have a French overdub track. ;-) It was a decent film. I'm not sure it was worthy of best picture, though."
Hold on to your seats lots of twists and turns
"A surprising like for me. Though, not sure why, since I watch subtitled shows all the time in Japanese. I really enjoyed the peek into Korean culture, or at least what I assume to be Korean culture. It's fresh and different. It blends seriousness and comedy very well, and it's definitely up there for movies I've seen. I'm not entirely sure about the message itself. I rarely find that movies can deliver a stellar message, like a book can, as they don't seem to have enough time. But it's very entertaining and worth re-watching, which I wouldn't say about too many movies."
"This was quite a film, the outturning events are rather very unexpected yet somehow plausible, you can't possibly predict the ending from its beginning. the characters actions were messed up and led to their deteriorating eventually, but we tend to not focus on the circumstances that led to those actions, It's perhaps the inevitable damage emerging out of endless desperation."
"Enjoyable yet anxiety ridden. A good watch, but doesn't quite warrant all the praise it gets. Good acting and a somewhat interesting plot."
One of the best Korean movies I've watched. The soundtrack itself was amazing. 9/10
"This movie is wild. Thrilling, funny, suspending, etc. great movie. Very unpredictable as well, which I liked, made me more engaged"
One of my favorite movies!
"What a rollercoaster. The first thing that stood out was the cinematography and environments in this film which are gorgeous. The structure of the story is subtle and peels away layers as its interesting characters become more involved in the plot. The music elegantly heightens the tone of this film too. The film is multilayered and universal in its themes but may lose some nuisance in the narrative screenplay due to its translation and being ingrained in Korean culture. People leeching off of others is apparent. The social commentary here is blatant. Karma is a thing. But what I felt resonated most was the importance of family. The theme continuously appears throughout this film without you even realising but is ultimately driven home in the final scenes. Bong Joon Ho has constructed a modern film that hits the current zeitgeist of today, but in a way that will not become dated. Parasite is a weave of dark tones, intrigue, mystery, and humour, and is the pinnacle of modern international cinema today."
"I truly love this film. Its' dark, witty class satire is unlike anything I've seen in a long while."
Enjoyed this more then I expected.
"Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's best work. With incredible Acting, Cinematography, Writing, Lighting and more that's just sandwiched brilliantly together! It's one of my favorite films right next to Evil Dead II."
This movie kept me on the edge of the seat and I want to watch it again very soon. Crazy good.
"In the era of the complete domination of the superhero movies, Parasite is a symbol of sagacity with its allegorical story telling. Maybe a wake up call for Hollywood that CGI is not the one-way road to success."
"Interesting and entertaining, but not nearly as deep as people think."
"Only one word can define this movie: Spectacular.. I believe that giving academy award to it is one of the wisest decisions the academy has made... The story, its structure, the analogies and metaphors at the background, acting, the ending... Everything was great.. Strongly recommended.. Must watch.."
"A perfect example of ""I think I know what this is, oh wait, oh no"", the movie is surprising, enjoyable, and thrilling, and it's interesting how every little thing plays in the story. A really nice movie!"
"This Korean movie is a great one with lots of fun and trouble. The poor family help out in a rich families home, and make a lot of money. They discover secrets about the house that not even the rich people know of. Will they tell anyone or will they loose everything if discovered."
¡®The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members' A black comedy on social inequality! Something different!
"i like realism film very much , most of south kroea movie are good at it, and i think parasite is the best one. it shocked me a lot the first time i watched it"
One of the best movies of 2019
"No turn that Bong Joon-ho's Parasite takes is expected, this is a thrilling, insane film that's never ever boring."
The first-ever movie I watched that was in another language. The cinematography and filming was incredible. And the ending was really good. Highly Recommend. I really hope there is a parasite 2.
"Work of art, such a good movie, a raw look into reality and the ""fight"" of social classes, I don't thing we¢¥ll see sth as good as this one in a few years."
"Good, but not great."
BAM SMACK POW MIND BLOWN
"Another rewatch, and this time it's another Bong Joon-Ho incredible work. The first half was funny and entertaining due to the witty ways that the main family climbed their ways into making a living. This wouldn't work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script. The second half was where the themes became apparently clear. The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society. Through the conversations, we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes, and how fed up one can feel. The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle, which made the script even more masterful. Overall, arguably Bong Joon-Ho's best work. 9.5/10"
"'Parasite' is an incredible, thrilling, suspenseful, twisty, sophisticated film. Not one moment on screen is wasted when this exciting plot is unfolding. It is very difficult to praise this film without revealing any spoilers, but if you are even curious about watching this, watch it. The discussion about the classism around the world is incredibly realized. Every actor does a wonderful job and the production value is really strong which just adds to the value of the film itself."
A movie that digs deep into human psychology.
"This movie is truly a masterpiece. The storytelling and plot are just so well thought out and complex, and the acting is outstanding. Parasite is honestly one of the best movies I have ever watched."
great movie! A great cast with a great plot cant ask much better than that for a movie!
"Wow, this family is so poor that they don't even live on ground level, they live below the street, below society. I like the mother, she's sassy and doesn't give a damn to speak her mind. Wow, that place is like a fortress. It's so beautiful, pristine like a palace. It looks like it doesn't even belong in the city. Something's kind of fishy with this huge house and it's inhabitants and I'm very curios as to what happens. I've noticed from watching several Korean movies, that they have a really good sense of humor. Almost very random and unexpected when it happens. The madame is quite attractive, she's cute. She's also very lively and has a great sense of humor. Hmm, that wall illuminating all the dishes and kitchen ware seems important, very interesting. These poor kids are really street smart, what they lack in wealth, they may up for with wits and grit. Fake it till you make it I guess is their motto. Wow, I don't know what to think about this poor family. Their motives and their plan is quite diabolical. They've basically gotten rid of all the help the rich family had. They even got rid of the housekeeper who seemed like a nice older lady. They seem kind of scum baggy to me, they're scummy people. I'm beginning to think that this poor family isn't a family at all and maybe they like work for the same company or person or something? Dude wtf is going on? Lol! There's this underground room where the old housekeeper's husband is living down there? Dude this is so fucking weird. I can't believe they got away with that escape. Holy shit, that was butt clenching. It's at this moment that the movie shifts into a completely different direction and even changes in mood and genre becoming more of a thriller/horror. It seems like the main theme is this movie is lies and deception. What you see, isn't really what you get and you can't really trust just about anyone, even if they're recommended by a reliable source. It's very odd to watch unfold, but this poor family has basically integrated themselves into the lives of this rich family. I guess they're all parasites feeding off this rich family. I don't know why but now I feel like the rich family is going to do something unexpected. I feel like there's going to be some kind of fucked up twist that's going to happen. They were the stink bugs all along, the lower class, the poor. There was a lot of twisted moments from both families. Beautifully filmed. The cinematography and compositions are impeccable. A feat of technical perfection. Brilliantly and cleverly written. Masterfully executed and filled with plenty of beautiful symbolism and metaphors. My only problem with the movie is that it's hard to relate to any of the characters since they're all essentially parasites and they all have really scummy characteristics to them, both the poor and the rich families. I guess I could relate the most to the rich families son and daughter. Watching this movie movie was something very exciting and thrilling, I didn't know what to expect next. I would definitely watch this movie again."
A very good film. Is it the sixth best film ever made in the history of time? No. It is not the sixth best film ever made in the history of time. Can we calm down please? This is a good film. Let's leave it at that.
"Audiovisualmente hermosa, actuaciones espectaculares y una trama que te mantiene expectante, sin duda parasite es una obra maestra que logra transmitir el suspenso y la angustia al espectador; y dar un claro mensaje sobre el panorama de la desigualdad econ?mica en la sociedad."
The perfect combination of the genius mind of Bong Joon Ho with an all-around stellar cast creates arguably one of the greatest films ever made.
"A MASTERPIECE! Oh my, this film is unlike any other I've ever watched. Parasite truly proves that Koreans are capable of competing in anything. It's no surprise that this film has received countless honors and nominations, particularly at the Oscars, because it deserves them all. And the finale tho. It's a little bloody and disturbing, but it's also extremely satisfying. It's like watching Once Upon a Time in Hollywood all over again, but much better. I don't think I need to go into detail because it's flawless in every way. A film that is both distinctive and realistically remarkable. Go ahead and watch it on your own!"
An absolute masterpiece. A truly thrilling film that keeps you on edge.
"A dramatic and thrilling piece of film, a commentary on how lower class and upper class citizens are viewed and treated. The ending felt rather¡¦far fetched, but it definitely didn't take away from the meaning of the film. I loved this, definitely deserving of a watch and 2019's film of the year."
It's no wonder that this movie won an Oscar. It's nice seeing a fresh story. The acting was really good. I liked seeing how Koreans live and how they're culturally different from us.
One of the most overestimated films in history.
"great, cool storyline, interesting and really good acting"
"Great film, definitely deserved best picture"
) It was just a masterpiece.The director is a legendary writer too.
"What a masterpiece. A movie that makes you forget you're watching a movie. Even without the twist, it was still a brilliant film."
"Simply just a masterpiece. Amazing story, excellent performances, beautiful cinematography. Please don¡¯t let the language barrier prevent you from seeing this. One of the best films I¡¯ve ever seen."
"With amazing visuals, a solid cast, and a story that keeps your heart thumping, Parasite is a work of art and a must-see film."
Overrated in my opinion but a good movie.
It was fine. but nothing so Interesting.
"technically masterful, with excellent performances - a practically flawless film and an extremely powerful commentary on capitalist society"
Incre?blemente interesante...
A work of art. Genius film
"An all-around masterpiece. The plot and storytelling is spot on and perfectly paced. I was hooked the whole way when watching this film, it is a must-see. Well-deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture, without a doubt."
Simply amazing. Superb story and acting. Can't wait to see it again.
Incredible cinematic experience.
This was well made but very long and very bleak! Also I hated the kid being obsessed with First Nations cultural stereotypes I get that it's supposed to be symbolic of the rich family's insensitivity but using bastardized versions of a peoples' sacred cultural artifacts for symbolism in your movie seems still not great! Idk.
"Parasite is the most original social satire feature to have come out in the 2010s. It has comedy, drama, mystery, suspense, and (somewhat) horror. The ending wasn't too good, it felt like they didn't know how to give a film with this type of commentary a satisfying ending. But mostly, Parasite is a fantastic film that must be seen!"
"The struggling Kim family sees an opportunity when the son starts working for the wealthy Park family. Soon, all of them find a way to work within the same household and start living a parasitic life."
An uncommon film with incredible storytelling in an unsuspecting package. You won't even realize its intricacy in between the zany mixture of comedy and suspense until well after you've watched the movie. Masterful. Flawless direction and cinematography.
[The] toxicity of victim-thought.
Very good acting with great plot twists.
The only funny comedy that has come out on international stage for the last 7 years. And it had to come from outside the US.
"I decided to watch this movie after seeing it recommended to me everywhere, I began the film inferring from the title that it would be a really good apocalyptic movie but I came to realise the film was just a metaphor of the Japanese wealth divide and how far some people may go to earn enough to get by. The entire film failed to surprise me, though the ending felt too short"
"Watch it!!!!!!! I don't need to say a word, just trust me."
"unlike the justice league the snyder cut the parasite is not 4 hours long and actually good and balances its comedy, drama and horror elements with razor precision therefore it is pretentious therefore it is not kino"
"One of the best films I've ever seen in my life, couldn't have been executed better. Brilliant actors, amazing script, great twist, just marvelous!"
100% fresh baby no puedes darle menos a esto
"This movie is a masterpiece in all senses. Parasite portrays the intimate true about the social classes. The movement of characters show how the difference between classes in life occurs. The colors and the photography speak without using words. The script is amazing, the film is of elegant suspense that doesn't show itself and makes the audience scream Wow! every moment. I think is a good movie to explain the social issues in a decadent society, which only cares about not losing its position of power."
A masterpice with a heavy a realistic critic to the society.
Brilliantly compelling commentary on the ways in which the rich feed off the poor and vice versa - although only one side is doing so for survival. The disturbing climax illustrates vividly the great equalizing factor for all. Masterful storytelling that sticks with you.
"This film is unpredictable, creative, funny, suspenseful and the acting is fantastic. Best film I've seen in a long time."
"An invigorating and engaging take on class divide as well as the meaning of family. This film seems to go through many genres, yet it does so seamlessly."
"This film begins with the image of a pile of socks drying near the narrow window of Ki-Taek's house. He lives on an ""intermediate floor"", a kind of basement whose view overlooks a trash can where a homeless person urinates. The four family members are constantly dirty, moving between cramped rooms as they search for a free Wi-Fi network in the neighborhood. The description of this family is grotesque, just as the bourgeois description of the Park family will be grotesque. The latter inhabit the spacious house created by a famous architect, where the four members are scattered around the rooms and get bored with all the technology and objects at their disposal. The two cores are identical opposites (father, mother, daughter and son), like the reflection of a mirror. Director Bong Joon-ho moves on to a caricature view of the social classes, whose stratification is represented by the literal structure of the houses - see the rich man's house, the poor's middle floor and a basement, an even more precarious level that will play an important role in the plot. While the Park's wealth makes them naive and ignorant (no curiosity for the world around them due to the ease of their possessions), the protagonists' poverty motivates trickery, the ability to create all possible tricks to ascend socially. It does not take long before families meet and the unemployed manage to infiltrate the wealthy house, one by one, gaining the trust of new employers. The notion of parasitism suggested by the title works perfectly to describe the central conflict. The first half of the narrative is a delightful comic farce. The plans devised by father (Song Kang-ho), mother (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter (Park So-dam) and son (Choi Woo-sik) are as simple as they are hilarious, working only thanks to the Park's innocence. The director is not deprived of creating really exaggerated scenes, betting on physical humor and the blows of destiny that contribute to the success of the mission. The viewer needs to show a high degree of indulgence to believe in some of the twists and turns, as well as certain elements of suspense introduced along the way. Joon-ho is much more interested in the symbolic value of the actions and characters than in the verisimilitude of the plot, which becomes an allegorical fable of ants and cicadas, foxes and chickens. Fortunately, as suspense sets in, Parasite takes the precaution of expanding the social scope and visiting other families in a situation as precarious as that of the protagonists. This is the time to reveal the different ways of dealing with difficulties, so that the parasitism of Ki-Taek and her family is not seen as the only possible way out. The flood scene proves to be particularly effective in affecting the lower floors while preserving the upper floors. Aesthetically, the project demonstrates the pragmatic elegance of the director, who never sacrifices understanding in the name of beauty. The filmmaker proves an excellent mastery of tones, directing the scribe, the touching drama and the dark suspense in different, yet organic and permeable ways. Finally, it is not surprising that the narrative leads to tragedy. The script sees violence as the only possible outcome for the clash between extreme poverty and ostentatious wealth, between the boss's hypocritical education (who even likes the employees, despite having a ""subway smell"") and the restrained aggressiveness of the employees. The film builds a time bomb, accentuating differences and social injustices until it explodes in a bloody climax. In this way, it allegorically represents the class struggle, the ideas of possession and appropriation in the contemporary era. It is commendable that the text dedicates a privileged space for cell phones, ""gourmet balconies"", the back rooms - so many elements representative of the times in which we live. When the son is faced with a serious problem, he tries to put himself in the place of the rich friend: ""What would Min do in this situation?"", he asks. Her sister replies: ""Min would never be in this situation"". Perhaps this is the best summary of the tragicomic discourse, according to which social mobility is an illusion, and Hollywood dreams of affective reconciliation between rich and poor deserve to be ridiculed. For a family to occupy the Park home, the ultimate symbol of success, it is necessary for another family to leave, even if it is by force. To ascend to the top of the pyramid, the only way is war."
good movie http://123telugumoviehd.com/
"It has a brilliant premise, clever writing, and a style that's uniquely its own. There's something in it for anyone to enjoy. https://letterboxd.com/josephtomastik/film/parasite-2019/"
"Very overrated, but it's still good."
"Absolutely stunning in every way. Filmed beautifully, amazing story, twists and turns. A+"
"I wonder how long it took for the writer to come up with a story like this. I appreciate each and every technician and actor who's a part of this project, for giving the audience a film unlike any others out there."
"Normally I'm not much into Korean entertainment. The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG. So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched. Parasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house. Things don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hiding The only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal. Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come."
"It's a great movie , with amazing visual lenguage makes you feel disturbed , it's funny and clever"
"The movie is very important by reporting the social inequality, seen in the big differences between the houses in which the two families live, the employments of the both, how life is easilier to the rich family e all the difficulties that the poor family has to deal with. Another thing very well expressed in the movie are the selfishness of the dominant class, when after the man hided in the basement be killed, all the boss have to say is about the ""poor smell"" of the man that had just lost his life. Also, the movie handles very well that belonging to the dominant class brings some symbols, as the rich family daugher's access to foreign language classes, and the youngest son's access to art classes. And, in addition, rely on the services of more than one domestic employee. My only reservation about the movie is that it's history would be better exploited if it proposed a collective response to the social inequality, and not as response to it the social ascension of few people, which is desired by the poor family soon. That way, he would save his father that stayed at the rich house's basement. Finally, the actor's performances and the script are very well directed, knowing when to give the drama tone or even the comedy tone, when it was necessary."
Cool movie with chilling scenes.
This movie doesn't waste a minute. Seamless and entertaining story.
"One of my favorite movies of all time. Funny, riveting, beautifully shot, amazing work from all the crew. Highly Recommend! 100/100"
Great film I would give it 5 stars but I just wasn't feeling the ending.
"I mean, watch for yourself..."
"Led by Bong Joon Ho¡¯s powerful direction, a smart satirical script and unexpected twists throughout. Parasite is a funny and thrilling look at timely social themes"
One of the best movies I've ever seen.
"Parasite is a film that is both a joy and cringe fest at the same time. It is masterfully crafted in a way that you can't help but be gripped by the actions taking place on screen. This is a story about two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum that end up colliding their very different Worlds in a dramatic and somewhat shocking way. We are introduced to the Kim family in their dreary semi basement home , hunting for WiFi and opening windows to gain from free bug killing street fumigation. In contrast the Park family live a privilege life who turn their noses up at the smell of people who ride the subway. The way this film builds the tension and blends both humour with tragedy is nothing short of amazing. The story,  albeit , a well told tale of master and servants,  twists and turns to ensure you never see the ending coming.  It took only minutes for me to forget Parasite was a foreign language film as it quickly pulls you into the narrative and keeps you engaged throughout the film. In conclusion, Parasite is a modern masterpiece that tells an age old story with style , humour and horror."
I love the symbolism and class/identity struggle on both sides.
"The movie was just ok, didn't understand why the huge propaganda and oscars.."
Fun and tense. Bong Joon-ho once again proves that he is a master director and knows how to create interesting stories.
"Parasite is a masterpiece. The film tells the class struggle that arises from inequalities. The class struggle told without slogans, flags, ideologies, workers, pickets. But the lower classes do not want to destroy the system that produced them. They aspire to replace the ruling class, imitating its ways, uses and customs. The director uses plays of light and shadow, hidden places, everything contributes to increasing the feeling of anguish. In general, the director manages to project the many shadows that hover over our certainties, on our small and safe daily lives."
Best film of 2019 for sure
This movie was great. Definitely the best movie of 2019. It has a great theme and amazing actors. This movie really does a great job getting its message about social classes and capitalism out to the audience.
Just a phenomenal movie. Was best I've seen in a while. So many layers. ..very original. Well done!
"The first half of the film is good, but then it deteriorates to biblical proportions, it does not deserve an Oscar, it shows that it was because of racial issues, what a shame today's cinema gives me."
"No se me antojaba mucho verla pero qued? impresionada con la historia, muy bien hecha. Tiene mucho para reflexionar sobre nuestros roles en la sociedad."
"Every scene adds a sense of intrigue, thrill, intensity, and suspense to this already brilliant movie. It explores our modern social motifs and does it in an entertaining way. It is a true masterpiece."
"THE PERFECT DECEIT Every now and then a phenomenon appears in the world. The movie world is no exception. I know that the Oscars are one of the most popular events, but let's be honest, everyone who is even a bit interested in the beauty of cinema knows well that the Cannes festival really awards world-class works. For example, last year's winner of the festival ""Parasite"". After watching the movie myself I understood why. Bong Joon-ho is distinguished by extraordinary originality in his movies. ""Snowpiercer"" or ¡®Okja' are pure evidence that this director never repeats himself. He will always surprise us with a new story, completely different from the others, with something astounding about it. His new work ""Parasite"" also belongs to this canon, but this time Bong Joon-Ho presents us with a story that surpasses all previous sensational achievements of the Korean. This should be a review, not a spoiler, so I will try to describe the plot of this masterpiece as simple as possible. Let's start with the fact that the main characters are a poor Korean family (parents and two young adult children) living in a musty basement. The movie starts with a great misfortune, the wi-fi password was changed in a local area and the family loses access to the Internet. At some point we can all relate to this little ¡®catastrophe'. Sooner or later thanks to a friend's recommendation the family's son, finds a job as an English tutor to a teenage girl from a wealthy family. He quickly starts implementing a plan that will allow him to get his sister and parents to work for the rich. At this point, it felt like the entire movie was supposed to be a comedy of contrasting poor and rich families, and seeing the poor struggling to stay afloat. But don't worry the movie is about more than that. Most of the things that happen as the story unfolds are unpredictable. The unconventional creator doesn't give everything up on the plate right away. Parasite starts off as a comedy, we have a lot of black humor here, incredible plot twists, the scenes are erratic and the tension keeps growing. It is impossible to guess what's going to happen at the very end or even in the next few moments. And on top of all this, Bong Joon-Ho shows us one of the biggest issues of the world: the differences between rich and poor. Not only the script and direction in Parasite is excellent. The whole thing looks great in every possible way. The shots and music are a real feast for the senses, and the way the camera is operated makes us get to know the Park house like our own pocket. In addition, we also get a small look on a poor Korean town, which in my opinion may interest the European viewer. Also the cast of this movie did a stunning job. Parasite is told in a modern, poetic, light and daring way. This piece of art devours the spectator, does not cause any problems with assimilation, and at the same time is an absolutely refined work at the highest level. In my opinion everyone should watch this movie. It hides a lot of variety that you will not notice at first glance. It has an intriguing story, combines humor with seriousness and the both family's cannot be seen as good or bad. ""Parasite"" is an extremely courageous movie that touches on social stratification, and it does it in a daring manner it amuses and moves. Bong again provided great entertainment for us."
"A truly great film deserving of all of its recognition. Perfectly crafted with symbolism, worthwhile themes, and brilliant acting."
"brilliant film, hard to better"
"Easy to captivate an audience with just the script and directing, when the movie is shot on the Arri Alexa 65 with Arri DNA lenses. Minimalistic work was put into the cinematography, but the message and moral of the story was amazingly conveyed through a brilliantly written script."
"Parasita ? fant?stico. ? inteligente. ? engra?ado. ? perturbador. E sim, h? um poderoso tema subjacente ? divis?o entre ricos e pobres. Mas o ?ltimo ? t?o habilmente entrela?ado na trama da hist?ria que voc? realmente n?o pensa muito sobre isso at? uma cena fat?dica antes do ?ltimo ato. Ele mereceu totalmente o Oscar de Melhor Filme e Diretor. Ao menos para a cena de luta de fuzz de p?ssego."
"very good , modern day masterpiece. movie deserves every single awards won"
"The human condition: happiness, lies and money. 10/10"
Absolute must see and must see again!
Bong Joon-Ho at his best. Parasite is a masterpiece of modern film.
"Parasite is a satire movie, it tell that no one is perfect. Rich people can be fool and the poor can be smart. Everyone can do everything for their life even though they know that it is not right. The villain is not Park's family but it is the unfair society. It is the system that always helps and support the rich people and this system makes to the poor can't rise. Every scene is like a art, the audience can feel how they separate the class of the rich and the poor in one frame. And the soundtrack is very minimal but it is very emotional."
"Parasite, a new work by the famous Korean director Feng Junhao This movie keeps the audience engaged and emotionally invested from start to finish. This is a movie release since 2019 but I watched it during the pandemic last year I would say this is another few Korean movies that I want to give a high evaluation. The plot of the film revolves around a poor family and a rich family. At the beginning of the movie, the focus is on a Kim family of four in the basement of Seoul. Mom and dad are unemployed, kids are out of school. One day, Kim family's son was hired to be a tutor for the daughter of a rich family, Park Family and then he tried to let his family pretend as the highly qualified person and they successfully parasitized in the rich family while the rich family is quite unaware. This is a very novel movie. The plot of the movie is quite different from what I have seen before. It can make reflected modern society and let people thought-provoking. In this movie, no one is a one hundred percent perfect angle or a full demon everyone using obscure means but they just wanted to achieve their goals. There's a lot of contrast and reversal in the movie. The plot is very compact, with many unexpected developments. The contrast between the dark and the light side, the contrast between the mansion and the basement, and so on. There are a lot of details to savor, and maybe a few more. I enjoy all the actor's performance they do a great job in emphasizing the little nuances which make each of the personalities unique and I would say there is no redundant lens. In this film each scene, in the beginning, is the preparation for the following plot. At the end of the movie, ""the poor"" finally becomes ""the rich"" and leads a good life through their efforts, but all this is imagined by ""the poor"". Maybe the reality is so cruel, many things, imagine is very good, but no action, no effort, it will never become true. If you can only watch one movie I'm extremely recommended this wonderful masterpiece for you, this Plame d'Or winner of the Cannes Film Festival sure does not disappoint you."
"""Parasite"" is one of my favorite movies. Although the plot that reflects social inequality might make it feel hard to understand, the movie is presented simply and straightforwardly. I love that the movie takes the issue of social inequality to the core of the story. The film runs by asking us to ask questions in our minds throughout the story: who is the real ""parasite class""? The rich or the poor? Or do we all have parasites inside ourselves? The film clearly shows the main point of the story from character quotes, character actions and symbolic expressions. More than that, in terms of production, it is good as well. Every point of view, color grading, or even sound effects are meaningful and exciting which make the audience more involved with the movie even more. In the first part of the story, the story begins gradually, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters mixed with black comedy that reflects the social system of inequality. But at the end of the story runs in a different direction from the first. There is something more exciting and thrilling. Overall, it's still a really great movie and a really good script. Because the movie takes on heavy issues such as class and social inequality to make it more understandable. At the end of the story the audiences can answer the questions that the villain of the story is not the poor or the rich, but the social inequality that makes people be a villain."
Just absolutely brilliant! A ride worth every emotion. Watching this movie without nothing anything about it is the only and best way to watch it.
"Believe the hype, this is a brilliant film."
Shockingly relatable.
One of the most memorable movie scores in recent years with wonderful shot composition. I cannot recommend this film enough.
"A blisteringly prescient, radically original cinematic study of class warfare. Bong Joon-ho cements his position as one of the 21st Century's best working directors, and possibly of all time. His grip (as well as co-screenwriter Han Jin-won) on the story, characters, settings, and actions is unrivaled in its deceptive simplicity that belies an intense, impeccably-crafted, undeniably compelling complexity that treats its characters with wit, cunning, and intelligence. Song Kang-ho is phenomenally powerful in his supporting role, with other standout performances coming from Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, and Park So-dam. Razor-sharp cinematography, eye-catching production design, and a wonderfully flavorful musical score add significantly to what is already a profoundly affecting, narratively singular experience. A perfect blend of dark humor, trenchant social commentary, popcorn thrills, and emotional poignancy, Parasite is not only the best film of 2019, not only one of the best films of the decade, but, as its characters attempt to accomplish, an entry into the upper echelon of all-time greats and classics."
Love the message behind this and the way the final scene is done is jaw dropping
a master piece. Highly recommend it.
"Masterpiece, a must see."
Parasite is by far an independent artwork film it's really a dark humor with really remarkable cast really amazing set designers and brilliant directing and last year I've seen it in IMAX in 4K remastered and it's really outstanding and perhaps people not noticed it's a hidden gen of horror.
"An expertly crafted film that never feels forced or unnecessary, gorgeous shots fill this frame to frame it is expertly acted. Most importantly though is that it's the underlying messages about class division, family, and the crushing pressure that people feel just to maintain and stay alive. Well deserving of its best picture ??"
Your review will help others decide whether to watch.
Never has a more deserving film won the Academy Award for Best Picture! This film is brilliant - dramatic and funny and sad and a mind-bender to boot! bravo!
"A great depiction of social dynamics. Also, this film does an interesting exploration of morality."
disturbing but very original. Black humor entwined with class conflict and the struggle to make ends meet.
Um filme exelente que mereceu os oscars que ganhou um filme exelente mesmo com todos os g?neros do cinema
"It's a miracle that this film swept the Oscars - not because it isn't good, but because of just how good it is. A Korean language film about a family of fraudsters which features shocking and violent twists and turns - won Best Picture??! Hopefully this is some sort of turning point. It's rare that the best film of the year wins that award, but this year it certainly did."
The best movie I've ever seen without a doubt
"It's not difficult to comprehend why this film was so successful at the most recent Academy Awards. Every scene is filled with so much depth and emotion, and the story transcends the limits of any one genre. A thought-provoking portrayal of class, wealth and family, Parasite single-handedly opened up to me the world of foreign-language cinema, proving that some of the best films of the coming decade won't necessarily be in English."
A rollercoaster of emotions. I cried when I finished it because of how overwhelmed I was and how much I loved it.
"As a Korean, I can tell you that compare to other Korean films, this is average at best. It won the Oscar only because it is one piece of liberal propaganda for socialism. If you want to watch real good Korean movies, try The Taxi Driver, based on the real Gwanju uprising as Koreans fought for democracy."
"The unique aspects which the movie had were interesting. For me, I enjoyed most of Joon-ho Bong's movies, but Parasite is my personal favorite. This is because it makes the audience think while watching. Lots of people come up with different perspectives and that widens the view of the movie. Also, using expressions based on historical facts, filming techniques, and facial expressions were amazing in the movie. However, because there were lots of parts that audiences could not understand, I also craved a straight-forward message like what other movies give to audiences. Although it had some sad parts, this is one of the life-changing movies that I strongly recommend."
"Koreans must be very proud that the director of ""Parasite"" is a Korean Bong Joon-ho. To that extent, ""Parasite"" is one of the greatest films in the history of film history in the world."
"The best thing about this movie is that you don't know what you are about to watch. And once you do, it feels like you're simultaneously watching two parts of an act. All from its ensemble of characters, soundtrack, setting, story flow; Bong Joon Ho once again combined all these elements to successfully deliver such a masterpiece."
"The definitive modern class commentary, and spectacularly enjoyable to boot."
Parasite is an engaging movie or social commentary that really hits home and today's chaotic world. You don't know to what extremes people will go to to survive. But this movie shows you some options.
One word - Masterpiece
"spectacular, incredible, and wonderful!"
one of the best movie watching experiences of my life. a genius film.
"True essence of Filmmaking . Bong delivered this so perfectly portraying class inequalities with their psyche as well . With a powerful screenplay and exquisite cinematography, this is a true masterpiece."
"The direction, script, art direction, cinematography, acting, editing, etc... everything is first rate. Geez the production designer created an entire neighbourhood! Bong Joon-ho has crafted a masterpiece where every second in the film has a purpose. I almost never say this, but this film is a masterpiece because it has no weaknesses."
don't expect too much.)
Best movie of the decade. A true masterpiece.
"I absolutely loved it, very well done. The plot twist at the end and how it ended really made it memorable."
"""Parasite"" is as subtle as a sledgehammer. After a promising start, the film devolves into a simplistic, cliche-ridden, predictable mess, replete with the graphic violence that's de rigueur of contemporary films. The imagery, symbolism, and metaphors are laughably over-the-top, enough to make even a middle-schooler's eyes roll. It's about as sophisticated as a 3rd-rate TV show and not recommended to discerning viewers looking for substance."
Instant classic (i hate to say this but it's one of those i guess)
¡®Parasite': How Bong Joon-Ho Gets Under Our Skin
Superb! Really cleverly filmed and a really good watch. Can definitely see why it won the oscar
Absolute Masterpiece!
"Es muy mala pel?cula, con unas actuaciones muy pobres y no tuvo que haber ganado el Oscar a mejor pel?cula."
The story is quarky and the cinematography is simple but beautiful. But its just another stereotypical movie that depicts the rich as cruel and out of the touch. Over simplistic villians and seems more interested in advancing a narrative. The movie is worth a watch but way overrated for people not interested in movies that affirm a political worldview.
"Doing my best to keep this spoiler free, I would say that the film is watchable and it's probably worth seeing if only for social reasons as it does crop up here and there is most of my social circles that include movie fans. The plot centres on the misfortunes of a family and their ability to take advantage of their son getting his foot in the door of a lucrative opportunity. It's then a story of how things can escalate when you get into a situation you aren't in control of to begin with and the stakes keep raising. There are no glaring problems with the plot or characters, unless (I'm told) you happen to be familiar with South Korean culture. And the film does a decent job of making you care about most of the characters in it as it appropriately develops most of the characters in it so you can understand them as people. The problem comes in when you really start to pay attention to the characters and the decisions that they make. At it's core it poses the assumption that if you give someone an inch, they will take a mile. Which isn't unreasonable, until I add in that the mile would include driving over people, friends included, then it's a whole lot less reasonable and is only believable if we are talking about psychopaths. In the same way while the situation might initially seem understandable you are doomed if you ever ask yourself the question; but would you? If you and your family were in a desperate situation would you risk it all for more when the chance of you getting busted is actually pretty high? Probably not. If you were to seemingly succeed, would you repeat the process? Well, maybe since you were daft enough to try it again, but really, why would you? The film makes no effort to explain why they keep choosing to escalate the situation when they seem to move out of the most desperate situation immediately after acquiring the first opportunity, which was given to them legitimately. Instead they plough ahead taking risk after risk, then pretty soon the characters seem to forget how precarious their position is and make several obviously terrible decisions which act as a catalyst for further escalating situations. Culminating into an entirely avoidable situation. The biggest problem of all is that the means they use to go about setting up these further opportunities draw attention to how wicked they are as people and really sets you against them despite their own struggles. You then spend much of the film rooting for them to fail as much as you are hoping for everything to turn out alright, because although they were clearly desperate, it's equally apparent that they are bad people who don't hesitate to put other people in a situation as desperate as they have been in, so long as it's not them. I get the sense that this is supposed to be a duality within the film, but when one side completely overpowers the other, it doesn't work at all. The various bad circumstances that afflict the characters in no way comes even close to justifying their actions against others and just cements that fact that they are people who ultimately deserve to lose. That being said, the acting, which I have seen criticised, isn't bad. It's not Hollywood A-list but then placing that kind of expectation on them is unreasonable and they easily outperform some actors/actresses in Hollywood who have had repeated work in the industry. The music is perfectly crafted to enhance the experience and it's clear no expense nor effort was sparing in the sets. It's an experience that is only harmed by how obscene the choices the characters make and keep making. While you are watching you could become engrossed enough to forget these kinds of details and considerations, and if you can do that you will enjoy it. If you have an eye for the particulars however, Parasite is fundamentally no different from a B-list horror movie where the situation only happens because of continued awful decisions on the part of the main cast. I don't feel that this fundamentally a bad movie, despite how much I may have gone on about its flaws, but it's not something you are every likely to watch twice and I seriously doubt it's something that will be remembered as anything other than 'that foreign film that won best picture that one time'"
"Fantastic and creepy-as-heck. Multiple themes underlie and run throughout this excellent and engaging film. Constantly surprising and angular in the story-telling. Even after repeated viewings, I'm still left with questions about the thematic elements. Absolutely worth your time."
Parasite falls far short of greatness with an inability to contend with society and existence or with its clear conservative aesthetic.
"If you're thinking about watching this movie, WATCH IT RN. So many ""easter eggs"" and symbolism involved if you like those types of movies. Literally blew my mind the first time I watched it, and can never take my eyes off the screen. By far one of the best movies I have watched."
ARe you kidding me. A horrible movie about horrible people. I'm more horrible personally for even attempting to watch it.
"Amazing! Humoristic, dramatic and thrilling."
"The visual on this movie is great, i like how the shot this movie gave a ""poor-and-rich borders"""
"I personally didn't like the third act but thought there were a lot of good elements to the movie. Basically, I think half of the movie is really good, and the other half is a little absurd."
Class commentary at its funniest and darkest.
"A masterpiece! As close to a perfect film as I have seen in a while. Beautifully shot, atmospheric, funny yet tragic, a wonderful ensemble cast, great foreshadowing, and underlying themes that reward your attention and a second / third watch."
A comedy/drama/thriller movie with a random series of events that transforms on the flight its genre and the viewers concept about characters.
"Great movie, by far better than i expected. It changes the direction many times so that i failed multiple times to tell what is probably going to happen at the end of the movie. Aesthetics, actors, plot, dialogues: this movie has it all."
One of the best movies of all time. Everything about the movie works from the great acting to the amazing score. It's a study about social norms and hierarchies.
"The pacing, the storyline, the acting, the photography, the soundtrack, the humour, the suspense - all culminate in possibly, the perfect movie."
"Not sure what the hype is about. It's creepy and interesting, but I'm dubious about the inner meaning of it all: when some characters reach their breaking point, it feels a bit contrived, not deep and meaningful."
"Fantastic film, fully deserving of winning best picture at the Oscars among many other awards. Bong Joon Ho yet again with a masterpiece of a film. The film's plot really memorable and dark which was very unexpected because you don't see it coming for the entire film, the dark part of the film. The entire cast give outstanding performances and fully deserved to have at least been nominated for an acting award in the Oscars because the acting on this film was extraordinary. Overall this was a fantastic film, must watch"
"While no-one comes off as really likeable, it really is thought-provoking about the 'privileged class' and the disparity in living conditions. There are no heroes here really, only tough life choices. That said, it takes a heavy premise and does entertain, albeit with several grisly moments."
"A masterpiece of cinema, in my humble opinion, is a film that cannot please everyone, not everyone is able to understand well its profound dignity, it is a film in my opinion dedicated to people who understand a minimum of cinema. however I found it fascinating in everything, to see!"
"The hype around this movie is absolutely deserved. 'Parasite' is an intense movie with pacing that will keep you captivated for the entirety of the runtime. The twist is unexpected and works wonderfully to keep the story moving, and the combination of multiple movie genres works to the advantage of the story. Although Bong Joon Ho tackles social issues, he does it by seamlessly incorporating it into the plot. 'Parasite' is a must-watch, and it is incredibly entertaining."
One of the best movies I have ever seen.
"This movie absolutely surpasses all thrillers before it. This piece of cinema has solidified its place in history with its development of plot, characters, and wonderful metaphorical display of themes."
Great movie that explores many important topics. Only reason its not a 5 is I felt it lost a bit of momentum in the middle but still a brilliant movie.
What can be said about Parasite that hasn't already been said? This film is a masterpiece and in twenty years it will be considered one of the greatest films of our generation. Korean film just keeps getting better and better.
"It was a good one time watch, I don't get the crazy hype around it though. It's not that funny or entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it still is a good flick for most part. it's just the absolute nonsensical and disconnected ending sequence to the rest of the movie which made me knock off a star from it. The ending is absolutely chaotic and movie just tries to be a drama that too with inexplicable events which do not add up at all. Trying to keep this spoiler free so will stop at that but i felt movie could have been much better with a decent end preferably on the similar theme of entire movie. It's absolutely crazy how much praise this decent but not so great movie has gotten. Absolutely the most overrated movie of the year."
"A good film, yes. Worthy of best picture? Absolutely not."
"Internationally acclaimed Oscar-winner, Parasite has proven to be a masterful film. That much is a given at this point. My favourite aspect of Parasite is how the film develops from an extremely entertaining light-hearted movie to more of a saddening look at poverty, to its eventual thrilling ending. It is a rollercoaster of moods, which may seem disjointed on paper, but they blend so well in Parasite that it works phenomenally. It's one of the best films of 2019 hands down, if not the best."
Movie was good until the ending. Father goes insane for a moment because another crazy guy smells and the rich guy is pointing that out. Kind of a let down for that but the rest of the movie was good.
"Smart writing, sharp directing, and strong performances all around. Like watching two different movies, since it really takes a surprising, but relevant turn."
Maybe the best movie of the 2000s? Is there a better one? I guess Korean culture is where it's at these days... watch this movie.
"interesting.., too many things to say lol"
A glorious exploration of class-issues that couldn't live up to its hype.
"I'm not a big foreign movie person, so when I heard ""Parasite"" won Best Picture, I wanted to check it out. Finally, I was able to get a copy of the movie and it is fantastic. The story is extremely good and the film knows when to be funny (yes it is funny) and when to be scary. The look of the film is phenomenal and the way Joon-ho Bong shows the different classes is truly remarkable. The way the movie takes its time to show little things is great. I really appreciated that this movie was one of the firsts to open me up to foreign films. For that, I give ""Parasite""... 5 stars."
"Such a unique idea. Just watch this, no need to explain more."
"Very well written and deserved all the awards it got, funny, entertaining, smart-ass comedy. With some unexpected psychological and horror twists that throw you for a leap! So worth watching."
"I thought it was very good and really enjoyed it. It's a thought provoking film as well ? always a good sign. The exploration of the dynamic between the wealthy and the poor is creative, clever, nuanced, often darkly humorous and yet disturbing. I like a good movie spectacle as much as the next guy but I really admire directors, scriptwriters, actors and film crews who tell an engaging story on a small scale minus all the pyrotechnics and CGI."
What makes this movie truly compelling is that it has so much to say. It beautifully delves into the desperation of a lower class family before finding its footing in being a subtlety menacing tale of infiltration into a wealthier family's home through the manipulation of certain situations. On top of that it does a phenomenal job at looking into the psychological effect that money might have on people who don't have any. The film truly earns its marks when it evolves into a struggle between two parasitic families.
"It was quite brilliant. Many people are saying it's overrated, I don't know how they could say that unless they put incredibly high expectations."
"Very good movie. Interesting story that keeps you hooked with great acting, writing, and twists which lead to a great movie. Would recommend."
The best film of 2019.
"Parasite really is a special movie. It's so rich and enthralling with deeply layered characters and stunning cinematography. It's absolutely thrilling throughout. The film is rooted in such powerful themes of class conflict, poverty, and family. And it will change your perception of foreign-language films. Well, it changed mine."
"Bong's best yet. The greatest of plot, writing and visuals come together to make a compelling, hilarious, yet frightening movie. Go watch it on Hulu now!"
"Parasite is undoubtedly a masterpiece. Releasing on 7th February in the United Kingdom, Parasite has taken the world by storm, and for good reasons. This thriller/comedy is a marvel of modern cinema and undoubtedly one of the best films of the decade, with it already having deservingly won over 13 awards - even breaking Oscar history by taking home 4 awards in one night. Parasite (directed by Bong Joon-ho) follows the lives of the Kim family, showing the harsh realities of living in poverty and the slums of the city. The son, Ki-woo (portrayed by Choi Woo-shik), becomes the leader of the movement in his family to improve their life after being given a symbol of luck by a family friend. Ki-woo takes over as an English tutor for the Park family ? a rich, powerful household who the Kims are able to leech off of in order to work their way up in society. The na?ve head-of-household Mrs Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) is soon blindsided by the entirety of the Kim family, as their plans to remove the original workers of the household unfold successfully. Up until this point, Parasite appears to be quite a light-hearted film, however, things soon take a turn for the unexpected. Upon watch, it is clear why this film has so quickly been treasured by the majority of those that have seen it. Details as small as the film being separated by two specific acts are the reason it is so successful as a movie. It provides twists and turns that are almost impossible to predict for even the most keen-eyed viewers and film critics, even switching the entire genre of the movie when you least expect it. The transition between comedy and thriller is seamless and makes for extremely easy viewing, as two hours pass by without hesitation or a wanting for the film to hurry up at any point. A strong point of this movie is definitely the way the events are laid out. In most movies where action or horror takes place, we see this theme and set of sequences being dragged out across the entirety of the movie, often making it repetitive and occasionally boring after it having been shown already. Parasite however, successfully places the ¡®action' throughout the film in specific places. These points of conflict or climax are skillfully placed to ensure that they don't become meaningless throughout the course of the film. Another point of discussion is the soundtrack of this cinematic wonder ? more specifically the opening theme of the movie. Although the song is a simple piece on piano, it becomes very symbolic of the film as a whole, especially after watching it and then revisiting the song. The theme consists of an upwards ladder of notes, perhaps representing the climb the Kim's attempt to make in society through the Parks, with the Kims living in the slums and the Parks in uptown luxury. With a main image in this movie being stairs, it's no wonder why this song has been made similar to a climbing sound; ideas of climbing up the social ladder, with those high up in society being above and those lower are below. Despite being a simple piece, the emotions it can draw out of those that truly listen to it are powerful and I encourage all that have seen this movie to give this song another listen. Along with the main theme, Parasite's entire soundtrack is able to perfectly capture the tonal shifts of the film and add to the overall effect of some of its most powerful scenes. If you haven't seen Parasite already, I highly implore you to do so and hope that these common praises of the film encourage you further. This movie is one of the rare cases where a film is clearly going to be the best for years to come and be something to stick with you as a significant moment in cinematic history. Being the first foreign film in history to win Best Picture at the Oscars (and deservedly so), Parasite truly is a masterpiece of modern cinema and should be what people take notes on when asking how to make cinematic history. A tragicomic that is impossible to forget, Parasite receives 5 stars ? a movie I believe will remain a classic for decades to come."
"It was pretty good, the plot-twist was unexpected and a bit shocking!"
A MASTERPIECE by all means.
"The story is great, very methaporic. Recommend watching!"
A disgusting piece of trash. It did give me insight into how worthless both the Oscars and Rotten Tomatoes are.
"I have no choice here but to add my voice to the resounding chorus of positive reviews for this movie. The sheer quantity and quality of plaudits that it's received made it nearly impossible to be anything but overrated, and yet it wasn't at all - it was exactly as good as they said it was, much to my delight. This is the best foreign-language movie that I have ever seen and will likely remain as such for a long time. Its depiction of class conflict and late-stage capitalism appeal to my own political senses to a very high degree. I would have liked the score to have played a bigger part in the movie as I'm never a big fan of minimalistic music, but in every other category this really blew me away. Kudos!"
"Um filme que te prende do come?o ao fim, com a quantidade certa de humor, suspense e drama."
"Absolutely gripping, edge of the seat watching. Subtitles worked well. Fabulous acting. Great movie ?? best this year."
"I became interested in the film after reading a friend's review. Looked, liked, original! I watched the South Korean film ""Parasites"", I want to admit that I don't often watch Korean films, but this film really interested me. The duration is a little more than two hours, but this dramatic Thriller flew by unnoticed, it was very interesting. The story itself was quite strong, philosophical and humorous. I must say that the problems that are raised in the picture turned out to be very modern and vital. It was interesting to watch, although the final was not so strong, it was a little disappointing, but it did not spoil the overall picture. In the process of viewing, only one thought was spinning in my head... they did not live richly, and it was not worth starting. People, of course, are shown not from the most pleasant side, real parasites! Why don't they understand that you need to learn, work, and achieve. How can one benefit from the benefits of others? Does this make you successful? How can you use someone else's kindness? Get right under your skin? How unpleasant it all is... You can talk about this endlessly, it is better to look at it yourself and draw your own conclusions. I must say that the film itself turned out to be very high-quality, the situation is correct, everything looks realistic. Well done creators! I definitely recommend the movie to watch, there is something to think about. A decent movie! What is this picture about? A very poor family lives in a basement, barely making ends meet. None of this family can get a normal job. But, one day, a friend of his son offers a part-time job in a decent house. A rich family needs an English tutor. This is a real gift of fate! But this was not enough... Okay, I won't write a spoiler and recommend this movie to everyone !"
Pacing sucks and the plot itself is also very boring
"The greatest film of the 2010s. A thought provoking masterpiece by the always amazing Bong Joon Ho, who once again tells a great story about class."
one of the best movies I have seen so far
"A movie that made me pog - BigChunk / It was a very interesting take on society as a whole, showing the juxtaposition of how the poor were treated when the flood happened while the rich were able to freely live their lives in luxury. A really good film, that also makes you question the title - 1412"
A movie layered in perfection. Bong Joon Ho takes his art and uses it to reflect on the society we live in while leaving you wanting to know more.
"Master filmmaker, Joon-Ho Bong accurately delivers the perfect combination for a horror-comedy in 'Parasite' and It really makes the audience, including me, say this movie is awesome. And that's what I'm saying the same thing to whoever is currently reading this review. Joon-Ho Bong's films never disappoint, including Parasite. That's a big fat yes from me."
"All aspect of life in a film. In the beginning it misguides you as if cheating life is possible. I like how they describes the haves and have nots. They are not necessarily good or bad. But the wealth or the absence of it shapes who we are in the society. We are the result of our circumstances mainly defined by wealth. Sad, uncomfortable, and true."
"Digna ganadora a mejor pelicula. Interesante, curiosa, enigmatica, thriller por momentos, sorprende, critica social, llena de metaforas y pistas. Toda una intriga. Vistas 2 (se mantiene positiva en rewatch)"
"Parasite is fantastic. It's clever. It's funny. It's disturbing. And yes, there is a powerful underlying theme of the divide between rich and poor. But the latter is so deftly weaved into the fabric of the story, you really don't think about it much until a fateful scene before the last act. It fully deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and Director. If only for the peach fuzz fight scene."
"11/25/20 This film very much kept my attention. It certainly has an ""Us"" feel, with some unexpected and creepy themes. I admit, I did keep feeling like it was a Jordan Peele rip off, but it was still very good. FOr some, having to read subtitles the whole time is not ideal, but it didn't bother me too much. In fact, it may have kept me awake bc I had to pay really close attention the whole time. Very interesting plot, maybe a little bit much for those who are squeamish."
PARASITE by Bong Joon-Ho 8.75
"PARASITE is a basically flawless dark suspense-comedy about class (think Snowpiercer but without the sci-fi, and funnier). So many twists and creative horrors. Begone, jump-scares, Joon-ho Bong has arrived. (side note: please don't watch it dubbed. That's just disrespectful). I'm definitely buying this on Criterion, which it definitely deserves."
"I've just moved to this planet from another universe and I'm trying to understand you people earth residents. When you say good, do you mean bad? And when you say bad, do you mean good? I'm really confused. This movie is awful and senseless. I'm trying to understand how anybody could not only like this movie but give it an Academy Award!!! I'd better go back to a simpler planet. This one is too confusing. This movie was not good so why are people saying it is?"
"An absolute masterpiece. The story is portrayed in a such insanely good way. It's a rarely good movie, really."
Impressive movie. Very good script and acting. An unforgettable piece of art.
An absolutely twisted dark comedy that'll take a while to get over.
Parasite is the greatest South Korean dark comedy thriller of all!
"Before watching this I thought it was gonna be a load of crap and as usual I was spot on. Whilst it has some good scenes and good bits, overall it is a serious disappointment. I think because the film industry as a whole is mostly hype followed by serious failure, this might seem like a good film. Certainly it was different but to be honest I should have trusted my instincts and gave it a wide berth; next time I will."
"Quite average to me,don't know what the fuss is about"
Parasite highlights as much about the talent of its creators as it does about society and the observed differences between rich and poor. The architectural splendor of the Parker home and the greasy confines of The Kim basement are presented immaculately. The story intensifies beautifully and the feeling of impending chaos is gripping. It's as chilling as it is warm. As real as it is imaginative. This movie deserves its widespread acclaim.
It was overrated. The story was kinda predictable and the twist was unnecessary
"Easily the best movie of 2019, and perhaps the decade. A true film masterpiece. It's a real surprise how the film unfolds, with numerous layers revealing shocking, unpredictable and thrilling twists and ends. All this whilst making a political statement about the ongoing problem of capitalism rooting in our society."
"A film like this relies on a strong ending, and this doesn't have one"
"Everything about this movie was perfect: writing, sfx, acting, casting, script, plot, flow, etc. 10/10"
Living life on Auto Pilot without mindfulness will lead to decisions being made without critical thinking which will lead to very undesirable outcomes. Social fabric/harmony of society needs to be maintained or else we will disintegrate into beasts and so will our society.
"Despite hearing about this from day dot, I thankfully managed to avoid knowing anything about this other than it's title, director and subsequent success. Boy am I glad, because it's quite the ride! No doubt about it, 'Parasite' is a high quality film. It wasn't at all what I had assumed it would be like, it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting - and that's a positive. Yet, it's still pretty dark. It's a great mix. The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out - the ending is particularly nuts. The cast do a fantastic job, especially the main quartet. Song Kang-ho would be my personal standout, I enjoyed watching him throughout. Choi Woo-shik is very good too, as are Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin. All of the onscreen talent do terrific though, from Cho Yeo-jeong to Lee Jung-eun. I don't have any negatives for this, it's a brilliant film. From the cinematography, to the dialogue, to the locations, to the humour. You name it, this produces it on an impressive level. Not that I need to say this, given I'm seemingly one of the last few who hadn't, but you must watch this!"
"An incredibly complicated and muddy mediation on global consumerism and local consumerism, social status, and family bonds. I was grateful to see this movie in the theater."
Believe the Hype for a subtitled movie to get this much attention and this much recognition and have this great of a box office you know the movie is great and an original story but tons of of twist humor and violence the only negative reviews are from pretentious critics
"I've done it. My First ever 5 star rating for rotton tomatoes and trust me my fellow humans. Get past the fact that this is a Korean film and read the subtitles. You will laugh, cry smile and then with 40 min left ur jaw will no doubt hit the floor by the insane things that end up happening and it's horrific. Like.... Life changing horrific."
"Incredible, Awesome, Amazing, Epic, Fun, Brilliant, Electrifying, Exciting, Great, Funny, Good, Fantastic and Phenomenal!"
Really great movie with very little nitpicking I could do. It's captivating & one hell of a watch.
"So much, just outstanding of these actors and directors. Beautiful."
"An intensely entertaining film, full of class commentary, full of surprises, and with an ending that came out of the blue."
This is the most original movie I've seen in a long time. And I loved every single minute of it!!!!
Everything was just right in this movie. I wish I could give a 6 star rating
"Not a bad movie, but wholly undeserving of the excessive praise, much less Best Picture! Nevertheless, seeing an Asian, non-English film reach this level of recognition by Hollywood is a much welcome step in the right direction toward making films a more international and universal medium."
La pel?cula no tiene sentido ni coherencia
"The movie showed a humorous look at the clear difference between rich and poor, also a fight between poor people to survive in society. The film was so realistic, and hurtful, it reminded me to remember my childhood."
one of the best of 2019 great characters and an incredible cast in addition to a mouth-watering script
"It's a good movie which masters the class critique but at the end of the day , its just a movie and far from reality."
"Ganadora del oscar,es original,pero no me gusto la historia 6/10"
"Did no one else notice that this was a remake of H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine,"" with a focus on the battle between the Eloi and Morlocks? But, I guess a battle between the haves and the have-nots is a common troupe in literature and film."
A twisted masterpiece!
Extraordinary film. Well deserved of the best picture Oscar.
"Great concept and well filmed but nasty and unpleasant experience. I mean we know there is an Upstairs Downstairs don't we? As with this ""And as a kind of chaotic both external and internal bloody class warfare ensues. Essentially creating for the amusement of the giddy bourgeois popcorn audience - both consumers and critics - a cinematic 21st century gladiator spree. Director Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, Okja) presents a condescending, pessimistic portrayal of human nature, bereft of class consciousness or ideology. And a working class whose sole motivation is to go to extremes, or aspiring to do so, to replace when not feeding off the economic class exploiting them - and in the process eliminating any potential workingclass competitors as well."" https://wbairadiowomen.blogspot.com/2019/10/parasite-deplorables-south-korea-style.html"
A must see! Great Korean movie it will make you nervous. it shocked me with the plot twists. great conversation between characters. a great movie. I would recommend to watch it alone or with someone who loves movies because you need to focus in the movie but believe me you will want to talk about this movie after its over. 10/10 for sure
"Deserved every award it won and much more. This high paced thriller is original, beautifully shot, entertaining and surprising at every moment. Gone girl is the closest thriller that comes to mind over the past decade, but it is still unparalleled to Parasite."
Parasite uses its premise to deliver rich social commentary along with clever and subtle metaphors to create a truly fantastic movie showing the pros and cons of an extreme lifestyle. This brilliantly crafted film has cemented its director Bong Joon-Ho as a filmmaking legend.
"*slow clap* Mind-bending drama, I was completely absorbed into the world built by Bong Joon Ho and team. If anyone is reading this, just go watch it."
Wasted two hours of my life. No point in the story.
"An extremely well put together film, Parasite manages to squeeze in well crafted social commentary, as well as provide intense moments of dread and genuine laughs,"
Mindblowing; an absolute masterpiece. The best movie of 2019.
"Quite original, got me thinking about it for a long time. Also, spectacular interior design! :)"
"This movie was very well done! It contained a bit of every genre you could think of, and was unlike anything I've ever watched before!"
"Fell apart as soon as the son started lying about perfectly competent sister, dad, and mom to the rich couple. Who deserved to get SIKED by these THIEVES. The sister was actually good at art. The dad was actually a good driver. The mom was good at housework. You think these people couldn't make their lives better on merit, or couldn't get hired by that family? Sure, the rich couple were dimwit *ssholes, but so were the ""good"" family. Could've been a real movie if the characters weren't caricatures. But that wouldn't bring in the money."
"brilliant, unpredictable, a bit slow in the end, but it has upset all expectations. Captivating movie"
Very original plot. I've seen some other movies alike but the way this one ended it really did a flip. Recommended.
Phenonmenal directing and ingenous writing.
"Parasite is the kind of movie everybody talks as great, but when you see it the first time you think they're wrong: it's a masterpiece."
good not more from this
"Absolutely one of the best movies I'll ever see in my lifetime no doubt. I haven't watched many foreign films in my life time and it's sad I had to see one so amazing to get me to dive in to them. So enjoyable, from the comedy, to the the suspense and the comedy IN the suspense. Please watch this movie if you love movies as much as I do!"
it was a great movie and I see why people liked it but felt slow at times
"It is funny and creepy and sad at the same time. And yes, sooo metaphorical."
"This is one of the best directed films of all time. This film shows hollywood is dying, and that these foreign and independent companys are original. This film builds tension so good, it also has some of the most disturbing film editing in recent years. the main setting has very unique. The character arcs are very diffrent and original than most films."
"This movie is going to catch your attention and get your mind into it, it is not a hard movie to understand, but it is a hard movie to digest. The sequence of this movie is perfectly well made and this film combine all movie genders including a black humor always, this film will make you laugh, cry, feel fear and anxiety, if you watch this film prepare yourself to feel a roller coaster of emotions experience, I'm sure you are going to love it! This movie reflects the consumerism, capitalism and social inequality that exist in our world, and how every one needs to become a parasite being selfish, care less and killing everything around us just to cover our on benefits and to survive. Also, this movie represents and show the fakeness of the society and how we are used to build and alternative alter ego to be part of it. This movie its one of the best movies of 2019, this movie has been in six nominations and won four Oscars in 2020. I highly recommend you to watch it and live a unique and amazing experience through it."
"I came in with much skepticism due to all the hype, but damn this was an incredible movie. I must give my first praise to the cast. They did an incredible job in making every character feel so real. Everyone worked so well together, that they almost convinced me that they were real people. The plot and the progression was excellently executed. Many props to the director. He strung together an incredibly well made film. I loved all the juxtapositions between the families, and I enjoyed the subtle imagery (well sometimes not so subtle). While the plot is a bit absurd, Bong Joon-ho suspends my disbelief. Once again props to him. Every scene is well crafted and serves a meaningful purpose to the story, and all the play with lighting really aids it. The only reason I took off half a star is due to the final act of the film. It is forced fed to us, unlike the rest of them film which everything is dynamic. I did enjoy the bleak message of the ending. Overall, one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Highly recommend."
"It's dark and dealing with social issues, but still fun to watch and makes you laugh often"
Tiene una narrativa perfecta y buenos momentos de tensi?n. Es una de las mejores pel?culas de los ?ltimos a?os. ¢®TOTALMENTE RECOMENDADA!
"I can't believe this. 99% RT rating and 90% audience rating? This film? For real? I'm giving 2 stars for the good acting, that's the only positive I can find. The end was the cherry on top of the cake."
Proof that even in 2020 every movie doesn¡¯t have to be a recycled version of everything else. Original story with lots of suspense.
"Uno dei film pi? belli che abbia mai visto, Trama ben scritta, inquadrate maniacali, attori perfetti, doppiaggio top. Se l'ha meritato tutto l'Oscar"
So many levels in this film about the rich and poor.
"Such a great movie. My second favorite Bong Joon Ho film, slightly behind Snowpiercer. Still a tense yet comedic film."
"Parasite has illustrated the big gap between two social classes in a smart, beautiful and dramatic way, the cinematography and the camera movement made the scenes very engaged, highly recommended and it deserves to win the best picture."
"I'm not part of the crowd that adores this film. I felt it was overrated. And one of those films where the idea of watching a bunch of unlikeable, fairly unredeemable, immoral people is somehow considered enjoyable just because...it's shocking? What? 18 year olds in art college make ""shocking films"" just because there is this weird idea in our creative culture that says if you do something ""shocking"" JUST to shock, you are valuable and entertaining. I don't agree. There has to be more substance behind it, rather than just that 18-year-old art student vibe of ""look what I'm doing! Aren't I SHOCKING YOU?!"" I feel like I see through it and a lot of people don't. Oh well. Also, the idea that this is intelligent commentary is misleading. The idea that rich are evil and dumb by nature of being rich, and that poor people are simultaneously superior yet completely immoral, villianous heathens is just outdated and weird. It's not a movie about an empathetic poor family who end up in a gray area and do horrible things that are also kind of justifiable. It's just random shock value with unsympathetic characters that people ate up even though it didn't make any sense. I mean... sure, if you just want to make a SLASHER film, then by all means, do it. But if I don't care about the characters that I'm supposed to, or, you don't even want me to care about the characters, but then expect me to sit through their lives and then call it art... not going to happen. I need emotional investment or at least have the honesty to admit it's just a wild slasher movie. I read an article that South Korea is actually economically doing really well and that this is a misleading representation, anyway. So, there goes the revolutionary commentary out the window. There are so many better foreign films out there. So many better films that comment on wealth inequality or classism."
"I don't really understand the hype around this film? I don't mind reading subtitles however it got very predictable near the middle with many tonal shifts. It is good, but wasn't worth it.."
"As the wells of inspiration dry up in modern filmmaking, Bong Joon Ho reminds the world how to create greatness. It's fantastic at a technical level and hilariously entertaining. Enthralling plot, brilliant characters, excellent dialogue. I have a feeling that in due time, Bong Joon Ho will find himself cemented among the greats. I eagerly await his next film."
"Pretty good movie by boon jong ho a really good director most notable to me snow piercer. So when I heard this same guy was making Oscar history I had to check out his movie. So I saw it and it's not that special, yes it does show how bad the lower class is in South Korea but I've seen so many movies that do the exact same thing. Based off the title I thought their would be some crazy epidemic like boon jong hos other movie the host but nope . Just social commentary calling the parasite s poor people which is really clever. This movie is pretty clever in that way and entertaining at times. To get to the good part of the movie it took a good 25 30 minutes. What I mean is the good part is when Kevin is at the house. The acting is amazing. I've never seen a foreign movie to make me interested in the acting. Cause reading subtitles is kinda rough, I know first world problems but still. I know people that will agree with me. Anyway it may seem that I'm hating on this movie but it's very entertaining but would I ever see this movie again, probably not. Maybe if my friend wants to see it for a first time but besides that I'll just stick to the TV show. Hopefully it's better."
Absolutely beautiful movie. Definitely deserving of all the award nominations and wins it received. One of the greatest movies I've seen in a very long time. Highly recommend this film!
Should I be happy or sad for the family?
Both entertaining and thought provoking. I'll be thinking on this one for a while.
"I watched this movie twice, and the first was just amazing and fun. It was only on the second visit that the camera composition that he had hidden double track and madly correlated with the situation began to appear. Bong Joon-ho made me goosebumps even after the film was over, and, as he said, under the language of film, many foreigners hope to overcome the barrier of subtitles and experience this film without prejudice."
"A masterpiece, a wonderful mobile, a picture of the society."
Just a fantastic film
"Overhyped , overblown, BORING and somehow, people think the story is original. Its NOT."
"Great movie. The story has no plot hole and is consistent. This makes it enjoyable to watch. Sound, lighting and picture are great. Overall, a very good movie."
"This movie is dope. Even though it was described to me as a ""thriller,"" it is not scary, there are no ghosts, and the whole movie is worth watching just for the montage where they're setting up the housekeeper. 10 stars for hilarity & execution, and almost no boring bits in the entire movie. Minus 5 stars for killing off the best character, and minus another half a star for the random sex scene the rich people have while staring at their child outside in a tent."
"Rich people bad? that's kinda what the movie is about but it finds a way to make it interesting. its the characters, this movie totally deserved best picture"
"Bong Jun-ho, he is generous. Nothing more needs to be said! You just watch this ????"
A true master piece story. There is no dull scene and the ideas from the movie are fresh and relevant.
"This materpiece holds your attention to the screen with a non-stop narrative who is awesome, the movie shows to me a debate talking about poor people trying to be rich, to me is a clearly Karl Marx debate about class consciousness"
Parasite is a film that not only lives up to the hype but far surpasses it due to the expert craftmanship from Bong Joon-ho. The script is near perfect with impactful and hilarious dialogue sprinkled with intense moments and shocking twists. Foreign films don't quite get this much mass appeal and that is solely because of the films strength to present a universal theme is a relatable but Shakespearean tragedy.
The funniest movie ever seen! But I don't know what to say. What genre is this a movie? The gap between rich and poor?
Absolute wonderful film makes you think long after watching
The deeper commentary on social class combined with the anticipation built by the score and cinematics are matched by no other
Great one of the best i ever seen
"Really good movie! I watched it with my sister, and we had a really thought proving discussion about it afterwards. The movie handles the divide between rich and poor in a fun, but ultimalty very tradigc way."
"Hey, that's a pretty good movie"
"While the film is not a clear-cut left-wing critique as many suppose, that is all for the better as it shows the ""line between good and evil cuts through every human heart."""
Great movie! 10/10! Too bad people won't watch it because they don't want to read subtitles.
this movie is..... Explosive!
Hated this movie. The ending was ridiculous
Parasite is absolutely a true masterpiece of independent film of 2019 and quite surprising a brilliant horror dark comedy/drama.
Story line is brilliant.
Outstanding! Delightfully clever movie all the way around.
Parasite seduces us with such a subtle suggestion of the path to power; using one's will to get what one wants. Yet only when we are woken from its hypnotizing allure do we see the devastation we have wreaked in its pursuit.
"Predictable, unbelievable, a film that's unaware of what genre it belongs to. I dont understand the hype at all. The premise was going somewhere until the plot devices kick in. Not quite a heist, not quite a thriller, whatever intelligence was present at the beginning got shoved for a strange climax and 30 minute long resolution? Pass and save yourself the 2 hours."
"Parasite should have been shortened before its releasing, but despite the lack of pertinence felt during some scenes it has some great gripping moments. Its outstanding cast also helped to turn an interesting premise into a whole different refreshing story. The cinematography is undeniably amazing and the director did a great job gathering all the pieces to construct something new."
"listen- i liked it. it was a rlly rad film. but why the absolute fuck did y'all have to go and kill my girlfriend Ki-Jung????? i don't get it???? she was a fierce warrior w a heart of gold and I don't UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD KILL HER. THE ONLY REDEEMABLE CHARACTER IN THE FUCKING KIM FAMILY AND U JUST DID HER SO DIRTY WTF\????// anyways, 10/10 would watch again"
An impressively constructed South Korean film. The lives of the rich and poor become entangled leading to disaster outs consequences. Just a superbly filmed story that you can't help but engage with.
"What started out as a more neutral, lighthearted seeming story, soon began to exponentially increase in the thriller category. Top marks for cinematography, as well as the underlying dark and relatable theme shown throughout the movie. Parasite definitely lives up to all the hype surrounding it."
"Parasite is that kinda film which you would love to feel through in your eyes.Perfect screenplay took this film to another level . Poverty can somehow beats up the world .But director does't shows it in a dramatic way, over hilloriously or by doing melo dramas. That's the spirit. Happy to watch it and i really admire this film to my heart."
"I did not know what I was expecting when I went to see parasite but not this. Parasite is over all an Interesting premise and entertaining story, while well written and decent overall production, sound editing was bad and for what it was the story moved to slowly and is frankly (while still interesting) absurd..... And only gets more for lack of a better word wacky as it goes along. The movie could have been an hour shorter and still been the same or better. Is it good? Yes But I believe it gained far to much credit for what it was this is a mediocre film getting the best picture Oscar just because weird is in."
It was an amazing film with some great cinematography and screenwriting.
"This movie had my full attention every second, the whole way through. It didn't have any ""slow parts"" where my mind wanted to wander or check my phone, etc. Fantastic acting, well written and directed...a great movie. And that should be saying something, as I don't typically like foreign language films."
"Parasite is a splendid dark comedy/drama. Some people need heavy rain to wash their sins away but this family of characters seem to drown in their own decisions. The story line is funny, dark, violent, intelligent, miraculous yet downright impossible. Parasite delivers a broad spectrum of theater. It's like a South Korean modern day twist on some vintage Shakespeare, 'deuce ex machina' included for the hardcore fans of plot twisting. Great ensemble, stunning visual sets, multi-layered plot...what more can you ask for? If all the characters are just trying to get by and do the right thing to survive, then how can you get a script to work so well with so much failure? Parasite uses multiple old-school movie/theater/writing tactics in a different, perhaps foreign perspective and the complete package comes off as fresh and original in a way that Director/Writer/Producer Bong Jung Ho rightly deserves credit for. When a film from Korea takes home 4 Oscars, you should think about watching foreign cinema if you already have not."
"A film that forces viewers to ask the question, whom is a parasite to whom? With every scene further proving that we might not ever get a right answer, it just depends what lens we see things through. Utilizing its sharp and witty script ¡°Parasite¡± takes you on a journey you never expected to take, let alone unfold the way it did."
"As good as advertised, and a little more complex in its commentary than expected given the discourse around it."
Xu? hu? pi?o pi?o b?i f?ng xi?o xi?o Ti?n d? y? pi?n c?ng m?ng
"Unenjoyable and offensive. What is the ""subtext"" on class meant to be...? That poor people are untrustworthy, unscrupulous grifters and murderers? That the class 'war' can never be settled? There's not a single compelling character in this whole steaming heap of trash- everyone is unreachable and/or detestable. Maybe that is the point? I have a legitimate hard time not judging people who liked this movie. You have to enjoy violence, and I don't mean the arcade stormtrooper-zapping kind. I mean you have to enjoy watching meaningless, graphic, up-close-and-personal violence. No, no, don't be all ""but it has mmeeaaaning! it's about class! it's sophisticated!"" no its not, that's a bunch of malarkey. If someone gave this unpleasant garbage 5 stars.. I am forced to wonder what would their reaction to other things be? If they went to an ophthalmologist who stabbed their eyes out instead of giving them a new prescription, would they review them as follows: ""Dr. soandso thinks outside of the box, a compelling experience, I couldn't look away, wow!"" Because that's what all these reviews look like to me. I don't know what disease of the mind you all have, but this movie is a solid minus 100 stars. It is not only unpleasant to watch, but the ""food for thought"" included is offensive garbage. Quit feeling all sophisticated because you watched a movie where class is a theme. This is just a misery-party, a everyone-sucks buffet. It's not sophisticated. It's a slow burn tension thriller wearing a fancy dress. I skimmed some of those glowing critic reviews. They pay lip service to the idea that it's about the ""analysis of the disparities between social classes"".. but any fruits to that analysis? No, all the critics move on swiftly from that and prattle on about the tension and the violence and the ""dropping the hammer"" on the audience. Because there's no clever commentary here, the class thing is just a setting."
"Parasite follows the poor Kim family who score jobs with the wealthy Park family, by impersonating as fully-qualified professionals to get even. However, things turn for the worse when the former housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) and her husband Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon) from downstairs threaten to tell the Parks of their exploitive soliciting, resulting in the Kims sneaking out of the Park house, them losing their home due to a rainstorm, them relocating to a homeless shelter, several family members murdered in a birthday party, Geun-sae fleeing scot free, Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) the patriarch taking shelter in the Park's basement, and Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the son, dreaming of buying the same upscale house. Putting aside the Oscar's racial overcompensation and its inception as the first foreign language to win Best Picture, this is without a doubt one of the funniest and most clever films I have seen in the past five years. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of the ¡®upstairs/downstairs' genre, especially because, aside from the period costumes, I find these shows or movies sluggish and elitist. However, what makes Parasite stand out is that it plays to the inner sadist in both societal merits, allowing for some outlandishly hilarious character-based humor. The Kims are the low-income optimists who dream of moving to an elevation bigger than themselves and the Parks are the naive, money-grabbing, spoiled snobs who rob from the poor and mock their ¡®old basement smell'. The movie also combines said humor with the more intense gritty Sam Peckinpah style violence and thought-provoking drama, to a point where the quality of writing goes into Coen Brothers territory. But those moments like the murders at Park Da-song's (Jung Hyeon-jun) party don't shy away from the film's theme of social rivalry and betrayal. So, as far as ¡®upstairs/downstairs' movies are concerned, Parasite is probably my favorite. (4 ? Peach Skin Shavings out of 5)"
"About half an hour too long with the odd bit dragging but overall, a film that builds momentum and has you on the edge of your seat by the end. Carries a powerful message on wealth and equality."
"Metaphors can be a problem in any piece of storytelling if the creator becomes so wedded to the metaphor that it al becomes either too obvious or too forced, and the narrative collapses under the weight of the meaning being attached to it. Simply describing the central metaphor of Parasite in the way it speaks to the film's theme of the rich-poor divide might make it seem that it's obvious, but it works deliciously. The plot is all sleek, smooth lines akin to the architecture of the house in which most of the film takes places; the metaphor is easy to grasp but never simplistic. Indeed this is one of those rare works of art that neither romanticises the poor nor demonises the rich, and it goes even better by excusing no one from their sins. It also switches genres deftly; from the delicate comedy of the first hour to the comedic drama/thriller of the second half. Other genre tropes are cleverly employed - especially hinting at aspects of horror and science-fiction, nodding more than once to HG Wells' War Of The Worlds amongst others. The film moves gracefully to a conclusion that's startling and that also seems somehow written in the stars; in the hands of an inferior artist it would be schlocky and clumsy; here it simply works as it's intended to. Similarly, the film's epilogue avoids sentimentality and manages to pack an emotional punch. That the film achieves all this within a seamless whole that is at once perfectly constructed but still humane and truthful is the reason is this film is so justly celebrated."
"Jesus Christ just HOW and WHY!?? THIS MOVIE LAdies and gentleman! THIS MOVIE... IT is just... it is just something else man... it is directed and made perfect, the acting is amazing and the script... yeah this movie is the best movie of the last decade and my favorite movie ever surpassing the dark knight!! love love love this movie!!!!"
"I just have to grade a movie is by how many times I would want to watch it over and over. I wouldn't want to watch the movie Parasite again; like Precious. It was worth 1 watching, but that one time is enough for life. I been to Korea multiple times, I've never seen anybody even in the poorest of areas, which are not many, live that poor. On top of it the idea that this tutor could get every single one of his family members to come and work for the wealthy family was so absurdly ridiculous...! It wasn't even believable for second! And that's what really bothered me from the point he got his mother in all the way towards the end. what also was not believable is when the father went and killed the rich father. As a viewer you were constantly being forced to suspend your ability to think logically realistically to the tune of none of it was believable after a while. There were some heart warming moments, sure. But they were soon followed by unrealistic story segments."
"Parasite reminded me of Haneke's Funny Games, Chabrol's La Ceremonie, Peele's Get Out and others. A beautifully controlled black black comedy with a savage and violent climax, it's very well acted and operates on several levels - satirising class, manners, the way plans invariably go wrong. The camera glides, the music soothes, the blood flows and the sewage rises. Unusual and intelligent."
"Watched this movie, and loved it so much I immediately watched it again. Despite it being my second viewing, I still laughed at jokes I'd heard before, and was on the edge of my seat during scenes I knew the outcome of. Film of the decade."
"¡®Parasite's' opening shot of a small glass window looking up from a basement house to the view of a narrow winding road, sets the visual language of the film firmly, right at the onset. There are many more such shots which metaphorically convey the social and economic disparity that is the central theme of this film. Especially the use of stairs going up and down, cramped spaces versus lush, open green lawns, delectably and elegantly laid out fruit slices as opposed to a clumisly heaped plate of food from a local kitchen. Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) and his family live on the edge of poverty. They fold pizza boxes for a delivery company to make some cash, steal wi-fi from the coffee shop nearby, and leave the windows open when the neighborhood is being fumigated to deal with their own infestation. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when a friend offers to recommend him as an English tutor for a girl he's been working with as the friend has to go out of the country for a while. The friend is in love with the young girl and doesn't want another tutor ""slavering"" over her. Why he trusts Kim Ki-woo given what we know and learn about him is a valid question. The young man changes his name to Kevin and begins tutoring Park Da-hye , who immediately falls for him, of course. Kevin has a much deeper plan. He's going to get his whole family into this house. He quickly convinces the mother Yeon-kyo, the excellent Jo Yeo-jeong, that the son of the house needs an art tutor, which allows Kevin's sister ""Jessica"" to enter the picture. Before long, mom and dad are in the Park house too, and it seems like everything is going perfectly for the Kim family. The Parks seem to be happy too. And then everything changes."
Thrilling. Entertaining. Dark humor. Well director. Love the actors.
"Funny and terrifying at the same time. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen so much it was great, net even checking messages, I swear."
"To begin with I'm not a fan of Bong Joon-ho. I discover this almost by accident because I had no idea that he was behind Snowpiercer and the Netflix produced, Okja. I couldn't get through the first one and I fell asleep during the second. I gave this one a shot even though I knew that hyped movies are not my cup of tea. They seem to be self-reliant on the hype they generate, that somehow should be enough to reassure us, they'll leave us with an unforgettable memory. So while this movie isn't bad and technically well-made, is far from unforgettable. It's heavy-handed and pushes the device of the screwball comedy far enough to make its subversion and consequent transformation into carnage, less plausible. A mechanism very dear to French director Francois Ozon, who Bong Joon-ho seems to be definitely indebted to. A movie that certainly pleases the crowds with its grotesque and cynical satire and its deliberate use of violence. To quote Calvino: ""What many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars."""
Parasite's story was not just story about poor and rich people. this movie see us how can poor peoples to parasite rich family. it was really REALLY exquisite!
"'Parasite' will be discredited by many solely because it is a foreign, but its original language should not stray you away from this film. Bong Joon Ho combines everything he has learned during his tenure to create a seamless masterpiece that is simplistic and engaging; even Parasite's sudden plot twist and genre flip seems so effortless. This film will keep you excited and engaged the whole way through."
Masterpiece! Had me at the edge of my seat throughout.
Highly multifaceted and thought-provoking movie
Did not see reflected in the movie all the ratings and reputation created by This film. A little bit disappointed .
By far one of the worst movies I have seen. A load of crap. A pile of garbage.
WOW JUST WOW. This movie left me speechless.
the only adjective I can think of is 'weird'
"A raucous rollercoaster of genre from sleek crime caper to bone-chilling horror that evokes screams of laughter and terror in equal measure, with zero clue as to what new emotion or surprise may be lurking behind the next left turn."
Korean cinema is always that girl. Part of the reason this movie hits so hard is because it's unafraid to really dig into the nitty-gritty of classicism and take a stance. It gets even more timely with each passing year.
"It's a wonderfully sneaky film that, before you know it, will have worked its way right under your skin."
"Fundamentally, Parasite aims to make us reflect on today's society, where the gap between the rich, the middle class and the poor is increasing.The spatial construction that the film proposes is a metaphor for the cruel social pyramid system."
"Parasite is both darkly hilarious and delightfully shocking, setting a new sky-high standard for black comedy ? the style of Bong Joon-ho."
"¡°Parasite¡± does not put a foot wrong in either of its thematic or narrative capabilities. Via suspenseful drama, dark comedy, and an ingenious script and set design, the film offers commentary worthy of Ken Loach."
"It¡¯s a tricky balancing act, much like Bong¡¯s abrupt shifts in tone, as Parasite is arguably the best film of the year at genre manipulation..."
Parasite is the movie we will look back on as the movie of 2019. It crosses over to every culture because it¡¯s simply about human beings struggling to survive in an unfair system.
"It is sadistic, angry and dark and has a lot to say about the system. This is the world we live in."
"""Parasite"" has already made history for South Korea as the country's first film to win a Best Picture Academy Award. There are some moments I can't wrap my head around though, and one of them was the inclusion of Illinois State into the dialogue."
"Cinematography, score, editing¡¦ everything¡¯s absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. It would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it¡¯s in a foreign language."
"Radically different films such as Knives Out, Us and Joker ... have all expressed the same social criticism. Parasite is perhaps the most pointed, explicitly showing how economic inequality brings out the worst in everyone, rich and poor alike."
"Bong Joon Ho¡¯s many-sided, dark social satire is a cunning and resourceful commentary on South Korea¡¯s economic inequality. Why it works is the relevance of that system across societies of every nation."
"These tiny details underline the inherent horror, and concur with the genre-defying essence of the story..."
Parasite will move you like nothing else.
It is the last good thing that has happened since the shutdown...
Visually stunning and searing satire...
"Incredible storytelling and examination of the class structure in Korea... Strong characterisation and performances create empathy from audiences, themselves becoming parasites to the film as host. Clinging on for dear life until the thrilling conclusion."
"Delicate directing and immaculate production design make Parasite the masterpiece it is. Its social-study script belongs in a lab, as it comes with storytelling lessons that transcend language. Reason why it became universal. [Full review in Spanish]"
"With a delicious black comedy edge, some surprising jolts of heartfelt emotion, and a violent throat punch when you¡¯re least expecting it, ¡°Parasite¡± is a movie that keeps you engaged and guessing."
"Here is a dark comedy from the great Bong Joon-Ho about class warfare that, depending on your mood, you may find to be a work of genius or too self-indulgent. One thing is certain, you¡¯ve never seen anything quite like it."
Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a wryly detailed and superbly scripted portrait of contemporary class rage.
"This is a filmmaker working at the top of his game, aided by brilliant satirical writing that feels as culturally relevant as it is emotionally resonant. It is a flawless knockout in every sense of the word."
"Though Bong calls Parasite a ""tragicomedy"" and layers the material with lively humor and his signature tonal playfulness, it's also his most furious and most fatalistic picture to date."
"Bong Joon-ho has created something with Parasite thats darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic, poignant, and bittersweet all at the same time."
Episode 52: Jojo Rabbit / The Lighthouse / Parasite
A twist-laden narrative that effortlessly shapeshifts from comedy to drama to thriller with liquid ease.
"My respect for Bong Joon-Ho is up in the sky, because he and everyone else involved in this movie pretty much knocked it out of the park on multiple fronts."
"A bonkers, beautiful, radical, and drop-dead intelligent dark satirical tale of social inequality [and the] mock egalitarian weirdness of late capitalism."
"Like Ki-Jung, Park So-dam is the standout in a film filled with strong performances."
"Parasite finds a way to be visually stunning, thematically resonant, horrifyingly tragic and fantastically gripping while fooling the audience into thinking they are having the time of their life."
"It is such a clash of different genres and moods that it may as well be considered genreless, and yet it all somehow comes together in such a masterful way that you cannot help but leave the theater in a state of awe."
"Parasite is a master class in storytelling, providing one of the finest examples of how to entertain the masses while still telling a deep and meaningful story."
I'll just come out and say it. Parasite is a masterpiece.
The film feels too insincere and hypocritical to take genuinely seriously on its theme of social injustice.
"Boon Joon Ho keeps us thoroughly enthralled as the story unfolds, deftly calibrating shifts in tone between satire, screwball farce, black comedy and horror, and also nimbly balancing our sympathies between the two families."
"A splendid take on class inequalities that force the audience to question who is the parasite, the rich or the poor."
"Not content with a basic premise of crime and punishment, director Bong Joon Ho goes a step further, eventually corkscrewing off on a tangent that drags out the running time."
"Precisely controlled and drolly ironic in tone even as its events grow more and more berserk, Parasite is always entertaining, foremost."
Every actor brings different nuances to their respective portrayals and is completely in sync with the picture's seriocomic tone.
Bong's work was leading to this galvanizing movie which has really shocked people into further questioning the wealth gap and understanding the precariousness of the urban underclass in an era of climate change...
"One of the best films of the decade and of Korean cinema (a nation that, by the way, has one of the most interesting filmographies of contemporary times). Its greatest strength is telling a story small but so powerful... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Bong's film is one which reveals itself in layers and it's almost impossible to categorise - it's at once a black comedy, thriller, horror, family drama and an allegory about class."
An unusual director with his antenna attuned to social class...Bong has emerged over the past decade as a globally significant filmmaker.
Parasite was the single best film I saw in 2019.
"The most impressive part? That even though this is a crowd-pleaser, it somehow manages to be marvelously depressing in ways that don't hit until after the credits roll."
Gripping.
"It's important to go in as fresh as possible to enjoy the film's juicy surprises, which are unraveled with the craft of a master, steadily building characters into the scheme, inviting our complicity, then yanking out the rug."
What starts off as a light-hearted comedy ends up becoming a bloody thriller as Bong intertwines slapstick comedy scenes and tense artful schemes.
The fallout of socio-economic disparities that pit one class of people against another has rarely been put on the big screen with the kind of savage candour and devastating intensity that Bong brings.
"Bong Joon-ho masterfully sets the table, and then delivers a raw, brutal critique to society. A masterpiece and one of 2019 best films. [Full review in Spanish]"
Parasite is a stunning achievement. It's a work that is as keenly prescient as it is superbly crafted.
"I can say, without fear of being wrong, that this is one of the best movies of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Parasite is a masterful piece of social satire and dark comedy, a scathing portrait of both the upper and lower classes."
"In the movie's most vivid set piece, Bong demonstrates that water (to use a euphemism) rolls downhill: A downpour that is picturesque at the level of the mansion becomes a flood by the time it washes into the poor family's vulnerable neighborhood."
"Settling in for a narrative about a family trying to keep it together by overpowering the capitalistic battle, Bong Joon-ho has constructed a low-key tragic comedy that insists on being more than just that."
PARASITE is Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece.
"It's very rare a film makes a step-change in what is going on and the dynamics of the characters, and makes that work as well it does here."
"...director Bong is also working on other levels, not only making all of its characters relatable - the Parks are really quite sweet people, if a little lacking in self-awareness - but telling his story with a healthy dose of uproarious slapstick."
"A picture that audaciously devours the force of convention and transforms it into a feverish undercurrent, driving what can only be described as an engine through the odyssey of mayhem."
"Kudos go to Bong's sleight-of-hand narrative approach, as he seamlessly defying genres by alternating from drama to comedy to thriller and back again over the course of its 131-minute running time."
Some satire but not at its best. And ugliness filled in the rest.
A film that is genre-defying and free of the restraints of conventional storytelling.
"With each passing day, Bong Joon-ho's class-conscious thriller about a family that lives in a sub-basement-and the blissfully na?ve rich family they wind up working for-becomes even more prescient."
"Get ready for thrills and laughter. As the credits roll, all the layers of meaning in every shot, character and object become clear and you can't wait to spread the word. This is what cinema does best -- entertain, provoke, create discussion."
"Everything is superbly controlled and nailed to the point at which you begin to question, how is this possible?"
"Parasite surprised me over and over. I constantly had no idea what was going to happen next. But what did happen, was amazing and extremely well done."
"When the history of this moment in world cinema is written, Parasite will take its place as the movie that got the moment right."
"A monumental achievement in film and the rare film that goes from ""very good"" to ""historically great"" in its final act."
"The smartest mainstream film about class made in many years, Bong Joon-ho's Parasite lays bare the lie that hard work can bring anyone closer to their dreams."
"Never let the audience off the hook, Hitchcock once said. Ho achieves this in spades and with more than one hook."
"[A] funny, inventive, scary film."
"From his opening shots, Bong Joon-Ho establishes the upstairs/downstairs dynamic of his razorsharp, bleakly funny, unmistakably furious skewering of capitalism and class divides."
"Bong hoped to give his film a classic sheen by creating a 'b&w' version. He needn't have done this: with or without color, Parasite will certainly be classic enough."
"It is bracing, audacious, jarring, challenging and exciting, a devastating social satire realized with precision and intelligence in every perfectly constructed frame."
It's a very good story.
The acting's amazing.
I think it's a career peak for [Bong Joon-ho].
Watching that drama -- the bricks sort of build and then topple -- is so satisfying.
"Thinking very metaphorically may not lead to our salvation, but the consciousness it induces just might."
Parasite provides a potential turning point for international films in America. Bong Joon-Ho's mystery drama will capture the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide
The movie itself - message aside - is remarkably entertaining.
"It conveys very clear messages about classism and discrimination, [all through] an entertaining and visually arresting story. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's a splendid film, beautifully acted and realised, which manages to be both entertaining and profound."
A breath-taking cinematic accomplishment that will have you talking for days
"[Bong Joon-ho]'s work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. He'll make you feel at home, and then rip the rug out from under you."
This is what a true masterpiece looks like.
Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture.
"What's to be said about this film that hasn't already been said? ... because there is so much to take in, like a Da Vinci painting, the film reveals secrets and hidden meanings until you're left breathless..."
Cinema of the highest form. No headline will ever convey the power of Parasite - it's a masterpiece that has to be seen to be believed.
"What makes Parasite such a good film is that it tells a story first and foremost, so the social commentary whilst ever present isn't so overpowering that you cannot just enjoy the story being told."
"Ingeniously written and directed, plus faultlessly acted, this is one of the great movie experiences of this or any year."
"Despite the occasionally slow pace, an impressively strong finish means you'll enjoy finding out."
An impeccable script. [Full review in Spanish]
"Plugging into our universal disquiet about the inequality between the haves and have-nots, Bong has fashioned a darkly enjoyable class-war thriller in which the real monster is global capitalism itself, but there is nothing heady or didactic about it."
"One's left to wonder who's parasitically living off whom? The Kims off the Parks, or the Americans off their anti-communist allies?"
Parasite is a completely gripping and utterly entertaining masterpiece in which writer-director Bong Joon Ho has poured all his craft and vision into.
A tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul.
"This serpentine, unclassifiable piece stands as a highlight among the director's already glittering career."
"Far from hiding, the film's beguiling charm stokes the deeply dystopian vision of its maker. In Bong's world, despite tokens like a cell phone or pizza dinners, social mobility doesn't quite exist."
"[I]ts delivery - mixing social satire, twisty plotting and Hitchcockian tension - a masterclass in serious-minded but accessible mainstream filmmaking."
[A]s a filmmaker [Bong's] less interested in finger-wagging admonishments than he is in taking us to uncomfortable places with outr? plot twists that deepen and reframe what we think we know about the characters.
"Using industrial-strength social satire, [Bong Joon Ho] strips the veneer off the myth of classlessness, giving an outrageously entertaining instant classic."
"While Parasite has won critical acclaim worldwide, seeming to strike a chord with audiences for its raw class commentary, the movie's message is not clear cut. It's a dark comedy, but by the end you're not sure if the joke is on you after all."
"It works on every level which is, perhaps, fitting for a film about levels and whether you are at the top or bottom in life."
"Parasite is quite simply a supreme feat of film-making, a tense and hilarious jewel box of a film that draws you deeper and deeper into its wicked, absurdist satire."
"Parasite works as entertainment and analysis, treat and treatise."
An imaginative comedy-thriller with darkness at its core.
The word masterpiece is often too easily used... But you can easily understand why Parasite has been given that label by so many because finding a reason to disagree feels just as redundant.
"Though we largely root for the Kims, Bong doesn't allow anything as simple as rich versus poor, good versus bad. No wonder this movie speaks to global audiences - it's a parable about our capitalist world."
"A film that always has two thoughts in its head at once, a spectacular epic and tightly wound chamber piece, chicly sophisticated, brutal as a hammer."
extraordinary
"It takes a while to get there, but it sticks its landing."
A miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-ho's already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire that's as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic.
Bong builds the rocambolesque plot of Parasite from a solid architectural skeleton. [Full Review in Spanish]
"It's a gripping, existential, horrifying study of a nightmarish world - except that it is true."
"We see what we want. We want what we see. Woe unto the collateral damage we leave. There may be no more original schemes, but the best movie of 2019 is more fascinated by original sins and the shapes they take in the here and now."
"Intrigue, violence, gore and humor show us a Korea in which not everything that shines is gold. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Parasite is staggeringly good, a remarkable piece of filmmaking that immerses and unnerves. Bong Joon Ho's direction is that of a maestro, of an auteur unleashed."
"A masterful genre chronicle of savage injustice and a master-class in genre filmmaking from Bong Joon-ho, Parasite is a classic must-see for anyone who loves film."
"Quite simply put, Parasite is a thrilling masterpiece from Bong Joon-ho, a director at the height of his powers offering a film that is profoundly entertaining, wonderfully realised, and thought-provoking."
"In Parasite, Bong doesn't appear to be expressing empathy for the poor. Nor does he seem to be pointing fingers at the rich. He is, instead, questioning the very nature of mankind; its self-centred ingratitude and its propensity to create divisions."
It really is a must-see.
"Very few movies in recent years have left you unsure what's going to happen next, but even when you do, it's still a compelling watch. Quite simply, Parasite is a masterpiece."
"Stunning and intricate, it is simply brilliant."
"A deep and complex narrative, rich in social commentary, is intricately wrapped within layer upon layer of different complementary genres and tones."
"It plays like a brilliant con job comedy in the first half, before switching to total wacko mode at the end, with knives out and bloody. I liked the first half of this Jekyll and Hyde film a lot. The second half, not so much."
"Bong Joon-Ho here constructs a powerful and intense hybrid of genres, themes, and observations that grow and acquire sense as the story, which is full of rich details, unfolds. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Humiliation is transformed into resentment and fantasy into reality. [Full Review in Spanish]
Parasite is true to itself even when it stops being palatable.
"As with his previous features such as Snowpiercer and The Host, Bong has created an intense drama laced throughout with scathing commentary."
"Bong Joon Ho has delivered one of the most well-assembled and compelling films of all time, which flawlessly navigates humor, despair, satire, and elements of thrilling horror to create an experience I won't soon forget."
"""Parasite"" flips through about ten different genres and takes the best bits of each; it feels like a relaxing buffet that expresses and sparks a love of cinema."
Parasite is a major accomplishment and a must-see film for anyone who loves cinema.
Bong builds the smallest moments into something monumental.
"No doubt Asian capitalist interests are well-served in the end, there won't be rioting in the streets on the back of this one. A film is hardly effective satire if it doesn't point up a route to radical change."
... playful until it becomes diabolical... only then does (writer/director) Bong Joon Ho show exactly the cards he's holding.
The only real question is how high you'll rank it in your top films of 2019 or the 2010s decade list.
"Unexpected, quirky, funny, horrific, dramatic - all of these things, but also just a bit tedious in parts. Not your average movie for sure."
"Somewhere, the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock is smiling with glee."
Parasite deserves to take its rightful place as one of the decade's finest films.
"Parasite is one of those beautiful rarities in cinema, a clever art-house title with much to say that is riotously entertaining and easily accessible."
We are facing a remarkable degree of narrative skill. [Full Review in Spanish]
Things get darker still... But Bong never lets the movie's dramatic tonal shifts derail the narrative momentum...
A splendid movie. [Full Review in Spanish]
A revolutionary film. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Parasite makes us see a landscape of injustice that we normally don't want to see. It feels uncomfortable, but it offers us plenty of material for reflection. Bravo! [Full Review in Spanish]"
Bong Joon-ho succeeds in showing us that the worst monster of our reality is the system that we have built. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Bong is crude, direct, ruthless, and at the same time refined. The director doesn't deliver a moralizing discourse. On the contrary, he offers a crescendo where suspense and the grotesque come together. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"an elaborate thriller that at first seems to pit the have's against the have-not's, but is ultimately about how the have not's are forced to turn against each other in the mad clamor for whatever dwindling social and economic crumbs they can find"
We are before a remarkable degree of narrative skill. [Full review in Spanish]
"a parable about two families in Korea-one rich but dim, one poor but clever-and what happens when the poor household decides to scam the rich."
"Just when we think we know where the narrative is headed, Bong pulls the rug out from under us via turns that are occasionally dazzling, yet always organic, thanks to meticulous foreshadowing and his knack for slowly building an atmosphere of dread."
Bong Joon-ho delivers something really special: the best film of 2019. [Full review in Spanish]
"Parasite was too on the nose too often for me to give it my full heart. However, I loved an ambiguity at its core..."
"This is a mature, beautifully crafted piece of work and much cleverer than it initially appears."
[A] fantastic film. [Full review in Spanish]
"The conversation about the gap between social classes is cynical, fun, and exasperating, because Bong doesn't simply talks about rich versus poor, but things that few people dare to talk about. [Full review in Spanish]"
"I haven't seen another film that pinned down the essence of the year, wriggling and squirming, with such eviscerating precision. It's not just a film; it's a vivisection."
The only thing that you should expect is the unexpected.
"This isn't just a killer picture on all of the standard levels, however. Contemplating society's growing class collisions and inequities, Parasite also makes a killer statement."
"Parasite is cinema at its very best, and will continue to be lauded as a timeless masterpiece."
"It's the perfect mix of the director's penchants for tidy symbolism and unhinged tonal shifts, with a strong ensemble cast led by longtime Bong favorite Song Kang-ho."
Parasite is a well-designed kick down the stairs that you cannot see coming. Rarely does a movie take you on the kind of trip this one does.
"If the movie is a Rorschach of who you identify as parasite and host, it's a test you're just as likely to fail; a filmgoing experience that refuses to fit into any box, and forces viewers to breathe the dangerous air outside of it too."
"Let's just say that by ""Parasite's"" conclusion, what started out as a comedy of manners has become a furious snarl of rage and his most arresting social satire yet."
"Obviously, these are not new themes or issues unheard of within the global economy, but it's not often a filmmaker finds a way to portray it in such unique shades of grey."
"Even if its social message about culture and class (Alfred-Hitchcock-by-way-of-Karl-Marx) is laid on too thick in the end, this Parasite slithers most agreeably."
Parasite is a triumph by a director who still hasn't really made a misstep.
"It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way."
The entertainment this combination of crime thriller and social drama offers is undeniable.
"It's so easy for otherwise good and normal people to do terrible things, and it's never entirely possible for them to escape their sins."
"[Parasite] has so much to offer, you'll want to see it more than once."
"Impeccable, sustaining shocking plot twists and tonal shifts between suspense, poignant family drama and slapstick farce without ever sacrificing its visual flair and impudent sense of humour."
"This movie is scary and funny and utterly beguiling. If you haven't seen it, you must."
"Has other, more interesting, uncomfortable things on it's mind - and the most uncomfortable of all is [when] you start to realize none of these people are as bad as you want them to be."
Parasite is a mature and complex examination of the cyclical nature of the haves and have-notes. It's probably the best film I've seen this year.
"This is a movie about messages, codes and plans, subterranean communications and misperceptions. Parasite may even be a ""message movie,"" though it has an artistry that term conceals."
Parasite ups the ante by presenting the (sometimes literal) moral depths of the dream of class mobility.
"Bong drags human greed and its consequences into the light with his lacerating wit, unabashed brutality and heart-wrenching tragedy, turning ""Parasite"" into an audacious and explosive parable for our times."
a savage and spectacular social satire
"Parasite is a well-made, engaging, and memorable film exploring class disparity in Korea. With its darkly comedic tone, Parasite manages to entertain, while crafting a surprising and socially relevant experience."
"While the off-beat nature of the narrative surely will not appeal to everyone, those with a desire to be taken on a thrilling ride of many twists and turns will be rewarded with an unpredictable and unsettling sharp class dissection."
I was just glued to the screen...amazing.
"I tried to predict what was happening, and I was wrong every time. I like that...the acting was a bit different, and it took some time to get up to speed, but I really enjoyed it."
Bong effortlessly blends the horrific and the comic en route to the icebox talk that has viewers questioning their own attitudes and beliefs through the unanswered mysteries of the story.
"It is a difficult task to review films like Parasite, because in the end you have almost certainly run out of superlatives with which to apply to it."
"The cast is great in this film, the performances are really dope and l you really get into both families."
"In a demonstration of masterful filmmaking director Bong Joon Ho's (Snowpiercer, The Host) latest film is uncategorizable and that is a great thing."
Parasite is at once a comedy and a Hitchcockian thriller with shades of mid-period Cohen Bros thrown in for good ironic measure. This film is a solid must-see for anyone who values quality filmmaking with something to say.
"Bong Joon-ho's magnificent genre-bending movie Parasite is a funny, deeply satirical look at class divisions, told through the intersecting lives of three families in Seoul."
"Parasite is a carnivorous and ferocious feat of filmmaking, bloodsport framed with a formal brilliance and brutally comic verve. It's one of the year's best."
"Bong knows better than to deliver a lecture. Instead, he wants nails chewed to the cuticle and armrests bent, achieving such reactions with magnificent editorial flow."
"Parasite attests to a filmmaker at the peak of powers, telling precisely the story he wants to tell in a way that showcases his distinctive virtuosity."
"It is a sitcom with teeth and haunting moral echoes, no small amount of vulgarity and a smart streak of comedy."
Bong packs his frames with visual symbolism that speaks to contemporary times and writes characters on both sides of the economic divide that feel relatable and well-rounded.
"There's little doubt that Parasite earns the title of masterpiece, and will only grow in the public consciousness for decades to come."
"Bong Joon-ho's suspenseful, timely thriller that's perhaps one of the best movies of the year."
"The film is sarcastically brilliant, hysterical, clever, and frenzied. The cinematography is glorious! My advise, go in not knowing the details!"
"There's not a doubt in my mind that Parasite is one of the best films of 2019, if not the best film of the year."
"I'm still in considerable pain from watching Parasite, days later. It's that great of a film."
"With Parasite, Bong Joon-Ho has produced a brilliant social commentary, and what might well be the best film of 2019."
As with his earlier works... [director Joon-ho Bong] embeds a biting social critique in a dynamic narrative with unexpected risks and satisfying surprises.
"South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho's ""Parasite"" contains everything that's exciting about his films: a grand fluidity of camera movements and a framing of shots that makes you look into corners just in case something's lurking. B"
"A twisty and uproarious thriller, ""Parasite"" packs a ton of entertainment around some sharp and timely social satire."
"A scathing satire-farce-tragedy-horror... You might not like where it goes, but you certainly won't forget it."
"Bong leads us into this realm slowly and expertly, often relying on an eclectic soundtrack - opera one moment, a jazzy all-drums set the next - to carry us forward."
"Parasite is a great film all right. It is not, I think, to be missed by anyone who seriously cares about movies."
Filmmaker Bong does a superb job of immediately drawing the viewer into the deliberately-paced proceedings...
"One of the most intriguing, intelligent, and disturbing films of the year."
"Parasite exudes cultural specificity, with deep cuts to Korean headlines and reality TV shows."
"It's difficult to find a recent movie that defines in such a visual way, through domestic architecture, the perverse mechanisms of domination of neoliberal capitalism. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Bong Joon Ho has not only delivered one of 2019's very best movies, but the symbolism he's woven throughout the picture is some of the finest placed on film in years."
"The writing is fantastic, as well as the acting, production design and score"
"A trenchant commentary on the economic divide that exists in today's South Korea, one made all the keener by Bong's ability to meld elements of comedy, satire, suspense and horror...one of the year's best films."
"Parasite very much takes place in our world. Perhaps a slightly heightened version of it, but ours nonetheless. Mixing that with his usual dark humor and oddly specific characters, Bong Joon-ho has created an experience like no other."
"That's not ""savage commentary."" That's condescension. This is by far the filmmaker's most commercially successful work to date..."
Parasite is unique in its treatment of class and solidarity and is a singular cinematic experience.
"A meticulously crafted, satirical thriller that proves to be [Bong Joon] Ho's most thematically rich project to date."
"Parasite is a beautiful movie, wonderfully acted, impeccably shot."
"A bit overlong at 132 minutes, but generally so kinetic and vivacious that it never once feels boring."
Bong Joon-ho's wild 'Parasite' is 2019's first real masterpiece
"A contender for the best film of the decade, Parasite is a thrilling, absolute masterpiece from one of the world's greatest auteur directors."
"Do not miss this movie, it's a love song to the cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"It's a fitting movie for our times, and Joon-ho delivers with uncompromising clarity and vision. See it before the inevitable American remake sands down all its razor sharp edges."
"Just as many of the director's previous efforts have defied pigeonholing, Parasite delights in ping-ponging from one genre to another, defying expectations along the way."
"Joon-ho makes it all increasingly funny at first, until an out-of-nowhere twist sends both families into a sparkling but serious assortment of genre-mixed rides and wrinkles."
A once-a-decade social satire masterpiece.
"A thriller of the domestic variety -- with a playful sense of humor, startling twists and turns, and keen examination of class."

"Just when you thought a Bong Joon-ho movie couldn't get more weird or wonderful, he delivers a masterpiece."
"The bassline of modern art is thumping and pulsating with a fury about inequality. Often, that sound gets understandably but simplistically distilled into ""rich bad, poor good"" messaging. Parasite absolutely defies a quick synthesizing of its message."
"Which family is the real parasite, feeding off the other, is a provocative question that lingers long after the movie's ended and our heart rates have returned to normal."
"Funny, disturbing, and heartbreaking all at once, Parasite finds Joon-ho in top form as a storyteller, delivering a film like no other this year."
"""Parasite"" is entertaining and shocking, a thought=provoking examination of class differences that shifts effortlessly from comedy to social commentary to something approaching horror."
"Bong Joon Ho's Cannes winner Parasite is a fantastically dark, horrendously bleak portrait of classist indoctrination."
"Wild-ride entertainment that's by turns funny, squirmy, horrifying, and poignant, all in service of a zeitgeist-y story of working-class frustration...boiling over in ways the blithely wealthy can no longer ignore."
Seals a serious case for Bong Joon-ho as one of the great filmmakers of all time.
"The latest film from Bong Joon Ho is funny, thrilling and poignant, and is a must-see for anyone looking to fill out their Best of 2019 scorecards."
A movie about how the capital invades our lifes and our private spaces. [Full Review in Spanish]
