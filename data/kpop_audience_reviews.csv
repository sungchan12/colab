Logan D,Audience,"hree superpowered lasses totally not the Powerpuff Girls use their band as a cover for fighting demons. Things go south when the demons decide to fight fire with fire. Seriously! The have the leader (Blossom), the serious one (Buttercup), and the silly one (Bubbles). But, that's forgiveable because this film is such a blast to watch. The action scenes are frenetic and vibrant. I'm not a fan of Kpop so found the songs forgettable, FF thru some of them. I also love they based this on female shamans from Korean culture who dance and sing to expunge demons from others. Recommended! There is a sequel in the works.",4/5,"Sep 29, 2025",Positive
Aidric M,Audience,"Amazingly stylized art and animation, fun and interesting writing, and one of the best soundtracks from a movie.

Dave M,Audience,This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. Absolute Cinema!!! Cannot wait for the Sequel.,5/5,"Sep 29, 2025",Positive
Brielle T.,Audience,"Music, beautiful. Chef’s kiss. Wow. No notes. That gave it two stars. One and a half stars for the main characters. Rumi and Jinu. Gorgeously fleshed out, character arcs… I mean, the climax doesn’t have to happen the way it does, it hurts my fragile little heart, but I understand why. But then… the side characters. Lord God, the side characters. First, the Huntr/x girls. Mira and Zoey. They not only have minimal personalities and even fewer notes of an arc, they have the gall to try to make it feel like they did have one. I’ll explain using the lyrics of Golden, the song that plays during the climax. Zoey’s line is, “I lived two lives, tried to play both sides. But I couldn’t find my own place.” As soon as I heard that, I knew they were grasping for straws. I encourage you to watch the movie, really just for the songs, and tell me if you can find a single scene that explains this line from Zoey. Mira’s line is equally terrible, as it’s, like the rest of the movie treats her, superficial. And the boys, the Saja Boys are even worse. There is nothing I hate more than (I’m trying my best to keep this spoiler free) characters like them who don’t get, beyond character development, more than a single line. Baby doesn’t get more than a single line of dialogue. The others don’t fare much better either. If you’re a Saja Boy and your name is not Jinu, then good luck saying anything at all in any particular moment. Or doing anything unique that would suggest they’re anything but a shell of a living being. I just really, really wish they tried more. They have such a wonderful story here, and it seems like they were too scared of making this movie longer to make it much, much better.",3.5/5,"Sep 29, 2025",Positive

Matias A,Audience,"All though this is a kid's movie, you don't have to be one to enjoy this movie. You didn't even have to be a Kpop fan or not, the music slaps, the animation is out of the world and the story and lore is insane! This is a movie that has never been done before so there isn't anything to compare it too and that's the best part.",5/5,"Sep 28, 2025",Positive

Brendan K,Audience,"My friends were begging me to watch this film and I rolled my eyes and said ""alright"". By the end, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The voice cast is a force of nature, the animation is incredible, and the songs are very catchy and well written. Even moreso, the characters had way more depth than you would expect. It's one of the most pleasantly surprising films I've seen in quite some time. It put a huge smile on my face. For a film that would have never crossed my radar, it became one of my favorite movies of the whole year. Never judge a book by its cover.",4/5,"Sep 28, 2025",Positive
Grace A,Audience,Literally the best movie ever.,5/5,"Sep 27, 2025",Positive
Michael D,Audience,"Fun movie. Not written with me in mind but I enjoyed it. My only problem with it was it seemed overly edited. For example, the main romance seemed rushed and unrealistic. Maybe it's for the TikTok generation but still... have some faith in them getting through a few slightly slower parts.",4.5/5,"Sep 27, 2025",Positive

Princeton M,Audience,"Bro, this is that one movie where female superheroes aren't so focused on being too tough but also very fun, enjoyable and relatable. This movie is too good. The songs are very addictive. The fans are portrayed almost accurate. The expressions on the heroine's faces are so expressive. Overall animation is vibrant, colourful, so touching. The message the movie gives about self acceptance and friendship is very heartfelt and well put out. This movie overall is awesome. Very family friendly, This is great to watch with friends and/or family. Can't recommend this more. Sony nailed this one! Can't recommend this movie any more than this. It's worth the watch. THE animated movie of 2025",4.5/5,"Sep 27, 2025",Positive
Julia M.,Audience,Absolutely great hands down. No spoilers but I questioned part of the plot in the end but I loved everything else so much I’ll gladly overlook it!,4.5/5,"Sep 27, 2025",Positive
Abby T,Audience,If I could put zero stars I would. I only made this account to post this review because it’s stupid and no child or adult should be filling their brain with this stupid plot and stupid songs. Save an hour and a half of your life and go touch some grass and literally do anything else,0.5/5,"Sep 27, 2025",Negative

C T,Audience,Rubbish. Not for children. I had to turn it off after 10 minutes. Why are we idolizing fake music and inviting devils into our homes?,1/5,"Sep 26, 2025",Negative
Zack C.,Audience,"Excellent animation, art, music, and storyline, although it follows some predictable story tropes, that doesn’t take away from how amazing this movie is.",5/5,"Sep 26, 2025",Positive
Justin B,Audience,"I loved this movie, I fell in love with the heroines very quickly and the villains are funny. The soundtrack is incredible and a really good pop album in its own right. Also the mascots are great. It has all the hallmarks of a great Disney movie and is a fantastic film for children but doesn’t feel like a kids film. It’s a shame it wasn’t a cinematic release but still great. The characters are so likeable so Netflix can make a lot of money from this movie and I hope for sequels soon. I want to see Yumi and Mira and Zoey again, some amazingly well written girls. I especially loved Yumi, more than perhaps any female protagonist from any Hollywood movie in the last decade, she’s so relatable and real.",5/5,"Sep 26, 2025",Positive
Lou S,Audience,Not a single second of boredom. Very well edited. The music is amazing and elevated the scenes. The title might sounds silly but it's got a very good message and has deep meaning. Funny moments too. Great movie.,5/5,"Sep 25, 2025",Positive
Eric T,Audience,Just the best as the soundtrack fits so well with the storytelling….high productive value….sorry for Sony animation pictures and music to miss out on this cultural phenomenon as they sold the rights to the animation and musics….,5/5,"Sep 25, 2025",Positive

Adrian S,Audience,honestly it felt weird. i love the art and animation style but im not much into the songs and the story felt poorly written.,2.5/5,"Sep 24, 2025",Negative
.,Audience,"Graphics, music, are all nice though story plot could be better. The story seems choppy. It had a potential to be on similar level as Barbie princess and the pauper (which is AMAZING, in my opinion). Or even had to chance to be like an amazing series like Shrek. Wish there were more input on Korea Culture and explanation rather than having it as just fashion statement. Friendly movie for kids though.",2/5,"Sep 24, 2025",Negative
AleRottentomatos Y,Audience,9 / 10 i love the Song of this movie .,4/5,"Sep 24, 2025",Positive
Tyler P,Audience,"Let me be clear, this definitely was not something on my radar or something I ever thought I would be interested in before it became so popular. But I had to come check out what everyone was raving about. And my god… I loved it! K-Pop Demon Hunters is a fantastic movie that totally deserves all the acclaim and love it’s getting. Sure, it may not be completely my thing but I never found that taking away from my enjoyment of it. I was blown away by the gorgeous animation, cool story, and exceptionally catchy songs that are so good on their own but also elevate the story and fight scenes in such a seamless way! There’s also some pretty crazy ideas here that are thrown into the world building and lore — I loved it and hope they make more of these! It almost felt like there was too much for what this was, but man I sure ate it all up! I’m genuinely shocked this lived up to the hype for me! It’s super fun and creative!",4/5,"Sep 24, 2025",Positive

E4123,Audience,Always love it when dark horses like this movie turn out way better than anyone expected and become smash hits. This one even topped charts. I love the animation and story that somehow bridges k-pop and demon hunting in a way that just makes sense.,4/5,"Sep 24, 2025",Positive

Sheree B,Audience,"Fun, cute, creative, beautiful artwork, catchy songs, and a total outing of Hollywood's deep musical secret-not-secret... that the industry is run by Satanists who use music to own the soles of the stars and ultimately the fandom and everyone is falling hook, line and sinker for its evil.",5/5,"Sep 22, 2025",Positive
K T,Audience,"Came into this movie without a clue of what it was about and left just wanting to know everything about it. Amazing music, story, and overall quality. Havent heard such good music in a film in a long time!!!",5/5,"Sep 22, 2025",Positive
Ignacio P,Audience,"This movie is so good! Deserves all the praise and hype! Fun, silly, beautiful and exciting animation, simple but great story, and super duper catchy tunes! I am not a Kpop fan, but I love these songs and the story is actually more layered than I expected; speaks to the Korean experience in Western culture, the importance of friendship, and the idea of accepting one self.",5/5,"Sep 22, 2025",Positive

Doug P,Audience,"Okay, the hype wasn't wrong about this one. I loved it and I'm not always into musicals. So worth it.",5/5,"Sep 21, 2025",Positive
Idin k,Audience,"I liked this movie so much because the characters looked cool, the animation is super detailed, the songs are really catchy and I can't stop listening to them, I also really liked the story of the hunters having to create a barrier to keep the demons out of the human world. this is an animated Masterpiece and you all must-see it. Trust me, after you see it, you'll wanna rewatch it and keep listen to the songs.",5/5,"Sep 21, 2025",Positive
N/A,Audience,"It’s not my favorite music genre, but you can feel the care and effort put into the film, especially in the quality of the songs — all the music is excellent. The theme of good versus evil is older than the sun, but in this movie I saw it feel fresh again. That’s my perception.",5/5,"Sep 21, 2025",Positive
Charlie C.,Audience,Fire story line and the animation is dope,5/5,"Sep 21, 2025",Positive
Colleen S,Audience,"My daughter was instantly obsessed with KPop Demon Hunters after watching the film the first time. After watching it with her, I could understand why. The characters are amazing, especially the members of Huntrix. The fans obsessing over the Saja Boys took me back to my childhood and my love of boy bands. Secondary characters, like Derpy (the demon tiger with a hint of OCD), add a cute and fun element to the movie. The music is my favorite part of the movie. Every song is so catchy!",5/5,"Sep 20, 2025",Positive
Shaly S,Audience,"Very cute film. My kids loved it, and I can't get the songs out of my head.",5/5,"Sep 20, 2025",Positive
Giorgos A,Audience,"“K-Pop Demon Hunters is all glitter, no soul. It hides a hollow story under neon lights and noisy songs, mistaking style for substance. Characters feel like props, emotional beats are spoon-fed, and the whole thing evaporates from memory the second the credits roll. Pretty? Not in a million years. Meaningful? It will never be”",0.5/5,"Sep 20, 2025",Negative
Jacob S,Audience,"Even though a masculine trait is not liking musicals, this a guilty pleasure for boys",5/5,"Sep 20, 2025",Positive

Hate It or L,Audience,"An Unexpected Gem: A Review of K-Pop Demon Hunters I'll be honest, when I first heard about K-Pop Demon Hunters, I was skeptical. As a big fan of both K-pop—especially the rappers and artists like Blackpink and J Park—and anime like Demon Slayer and Bleach, I was worried this movie would take two things I love and mash them together in a way that just didn't work. But after being convinced to give it a shot, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the film is actually really good. The story, which follows a group of pop star ""Huntrix"" who use their music to create a shield that keeps demons out of our world, is incredibly interesting. This generation of heroes, the group known as Huntrix, is on the verge of sealing off the demon world for good, but a rival boy band of demons threatens to stop their mission by turning the public against them. What really makes the movie shine is its characters and themes. I found myself particularly drawn to Rumi , who is secretly carrying a heavy burden of guilt and working tirelessly to close off the demon world to find peace. Her struggles with hiding who she really is felt incredibly relatable and grounded the story. Similarly, the main villain from the demon boy band has a compelling backstory that helps you understand his motivations. Beyond the characters, the film uses its unique premise to explore powerful messages about the music industry, showing the conflict between artists who want to create meaningful, unifying music and those who produce negativity and garbage for profit. It's a powerful and relevant commentary. Overall, K-Pop Demon Hunters is a fantastic film that exceeded all my expectations. While I would have loved to see more epic fight scenes and get more backstory on the other members of the group, these are minor critiques. The music is amazing—so good that I've added it to my own rotation—and the blend of action and music is executed perfectly. The movie's core messages about staying true to yourself and fighting for what's right are also incredibly strong and well-delivered. It's a film with great morals and standards that won me over completely. I highly recommend giving it a watch.",5/5,"Sep 20, 2025",Positive
Matteo B,Audience,"Horrible movie, way too much hype and super cringy",0.5/5,"Sep 20, 2025",Negative
Robyn,Audience,Excellent experience! Being able to sing along with the crowd added extra magic to an already magical movie. This film was meant to be shared and on the big screen. Someone we brought with us to see it for the first time went home and watched it again multiple times on Netflix!,5/5,"Sep 20, 2025",Positive

N/A,Audience,"Em um mercado saturado de animações que buscam repetir fórmulas já consagradas, Guerreiras do K-Pop surgiu como uma das maiores surpresas do ano. O longa não apenas conquistou números impressionantes na Netflix — ultrapassando títulos badalados como Alerta Vermelho e Projeto Adam — como também se consolidou como o filme original mais assistido da plataforma até hoje. Mas o fenômeno vai além da estatística: a produção dirigida por Chris Appelhans e Maggie Kang consegue unir técnica, carisma e identidade cultural em um espetáculo que dialoga com o público de diferentes formas, seja pelo entretenimento vibrante, seja pelo mergulho na cultura pop sul-coreana. A primeira grande força do filme está justamente em sua animação. Desde Homem-Aranha no Aranhaverso, tornou-se inevitável a comparação com qualquer obra que experimente hibridizações visuais entre 2D e 3D. Algumas produções caíram na armadilha da mera cópia; outras, como Guerreiras do K-Pop, buscaram transformar essa influência em algo com personalidade própria. Aqui, o visual não se limita ao impacto estético: cada cena utiliza cores saturadas, explosões de neon e movimentos fluidos que não só impressionam, como também dialogam diretamente com o universo do K-Pop, um gênero musical reconhecido por sua energia, plasticidade e intensidade visual. O resultado é uma obra que mistura espetáculo gráfico com assinatura cultural, transmitindo frescor até para quem não tem qualquer familiaridade com esse universo. O grande trunfo é que essa estética não se perde em excesso. A direção não se contenta em encher a tela de cores e brilhos; há uma lógica narrativa por trás da escolha de tons e estilos. Sequências de batalhas são intensificadas pelo neon, expressões caricatas evocam referências de animes e ilustrações tradicionais reforçam a identidade oriental que atravessa toda a obra. Essa mescla de influências constrói uma linguagem própria, capaz de se comunicar com públicos distintos e, principalmente, de se destacar em um cenário competitivo. É legítimo afirmar que estamos diante de um dos trabalhos visuais mais bem-acabados do ano. Mas o filme não se sustenta apenas pelo que se vê. O que surpreende é o modo como a música se torna parte essencial da narrativa. Em muitos musicais, as canções surgem como interrupções: momentos artificiais que, embora cativantes, pouco acrescentam à trama. Guerreiras do K-Pop subverte essa lógica. A trilha sonora — composta exclusivamente por três integrantes do grupo TWICE — não é mero adorno, mas a espinha dorsal da história. As músicas não só marcam ritmo e emoção, como se transformam em ferramentas narrativas, diálogos e até armas dentro da mitologia criada para o longa. A música aqui é literalmente protagonista. E é exatamente esse aspecto que torna o filme tão acessível. Mesmo quem torce o nariz para musicais ou não tem contato com o K-Pop consegue encontrar sentido nas canções, já que elas não estão ali como espetáculo isolado, mas como motor que faz a história avançar. O próprio conceito de “carta de amor ao K-Pop”, citado pela diretora Maggie Kang em entrevistas, ganha vida na tela: não é apenas homenagem, mas celebração orgânica de um fenômeno cultural. O espectador pode até sair da sessão cantarolando, mesmo sem ser fã do gênero. Claro que a estrutura narrativa não é perfeita. O roteiro de Danya Jimenez e Hannah McMechan acerta em criar uma mitologia envolvente, mas acaba tropeçando na distribuição do enredo. O primeiro ato despeja uma avalanche de informações, estabelecendo universo, regras e personagens em ritmo acelerado. Funciona para prender a atenção, mas deixa pouco espaço para aprofundar conflitos. Já o segundo ato, ao tentar abrir novas tramas paralelas, introduz subplots que não recebem o desenvolvimento necessário. Quando chega ao clímax, o filme sofre com a pressa: o embate final com os antagonistas parece atropelado, quando claramente havia material para estender a experiência em mais 20 ou 30 minutos. Essa sensação de aceleração acaba refletindo também nas personagens. Rumi, Mira e Zoey são apresentadas como um trio coeso, mas apenas uma delas se consolida como protagonista central, recebendo maior espaço dramático. As demais, por vezes, acabam relegadas ao papel de apoio emocional ou de alívio cômico. A química do grupo é inegável, mas a falta de equilíbrio no desenvolvimento narrativo gera uma pequena frustração, já que havia potencial para explorar cada uma delas de forma mais rica. Ainda assim, esses deslizes não diminuem o impacto do filme. Pelo contrário, apenas reforçam o quanto ele consegue se sustentar mesmo quando não atinge todo o seu potencial. Guerreiras do K-Pop é um exemplo de obra que sabe usar suas virtudes — visual vibrante, identidade cultural marcante e uso criativo da música — para envolver o público e fazer esquecer as imperfeições. É entretenimento puro, mas também é uma porta de entrada para um universo que muitos ainda desconhecem. Mais do que um sucesso de audiência, o filme é um marco simbólico. Mostra que animações musicais ainda podem conquistar multidões, mesmo em tempos em que há resistência a esse formato. Mostra também que o K-Pop, fenômeno que já ultrapassou fronteiras geográficas e linguísticas, ainda tem espaço para novas formas de representação cultural. Ao unir esses elementos em um pacote divertido e cativante, Guerreiras do K-Pop não só se justifica como fenômeno da Netflix, como também abre caminho para produções que ousam misturar música, cultura e espetáculo visual sem medo de parecer diferentes. Em resumo, Guerreiras do K-Pop é uma das grandes surpresas do ano. Uma animação que conquista pela ousadia estética, pela energia contagiante da música e pelo respeito com que trata a cultura que representa. Não é perfeita, mas é inesquecível. Um daqueles filmes que provam que entretenimento e autenticidade não precisam estar em lados opostos.",3.5/5,"Sep 17, 2025",Positive

Porém o que os seus fãs não sabem é que elas também são caçadores de demônio e que elas estão prestes a erguer uma barreira que irá impedir os demônios de invadir nossa dimensão. Para detê-las, os demônios montam um boy band chamada Saja Boys e passam a dividir o amor dos fãs. Guerreira do K-Pop se tornou a primeira grande animação americana de 2025. Misturando o estilo usado na franquia Aranhaverso, com os de animê e mangá, nós temos um filme colorido, bonito, divertido e engraçado. Você não precisa ter um grande conhecimento da indústria musical sul coreana para aproveitar o filme, nem mesmo desse estilo musical. Nós temos aqui uma seleção de ótimas músicas pop, que, com certeza, conseguirão alguma indicação em Melhor Canção no Oscar do ano que vem, como o próprio filme se candidata já ao prêmio de Melhor Animação. A história em si do filme é simples, pode ter os seus facilitadores, mas não há como não gostar. Os números musicais são excelentes e muito bonitos e não travam o fluxo do filme. Netflix acerta mais uma vez.",4/5,"Sep 16, 2025",Positive

Nate W,Audience,You're a bunch of weirdos. The only reason that you like it is because it has good songs which I can agree with. But the plot is absolute dog crap and the script needs some work. When I say some work I mean a lot,1.5/5,"Sep 16, 2025",Negative

Kayleigh S,Audience,"This was heck a awesome. I was hesitant to watch this before because I thought it was overrated but now I get why it was such a hit. The songs were fire, the story was interesting but still worked. I'm officially a fan!!!",5/5,"Sep 16, 2025",Positive
Brianna W,Audience,"K-Pop Demon Hunters is pure magic. I absolutely love how this film has connected with people all over the world.

Seth L,Audience,"Few movies can manage to be enjoyed by younger audiences, teens, young and older adults, and men and women. The story is deep enough, and not overly-sanitized, whilst still being straight-forward enough to be enjoyed by the younger audience. The music is a killer, as seen by the current statistics(the fictional band is ranked 53rd worldwide on Spotify still, at the time of writing this review), and there's true passion involved in this project. 10/10, would kpop again.",5/5,"Sep 14, 2025",Positive
D P,Audience,"I happened to catch this on the one weekend that it was in theaters. I don't have Netflix. So, I do agree that it was entertaining. What I'm not understanding is how it counts as a phenomenon. Entertaining, yes. Mind-blowing, not quite. So, I admit I'm a little lost on that front. There were adults in there singing the lyrics. Wow. I'm happy for them.",2.5/5,"Sep 13, 2025",Negative

David G.,Audience,"The plot was clever. Animations exceptional. However, the music was next level. WOW",5/5,"Sep 13, 2025",Positive
J D,Audience,"Although this movie is very good and definitely entertaining, I do not think it should be as popular as it currently is lol (however, do not get me wrong, it is still very good). The animation is great, the music is of course great, the characters are great; the themes are powerful although perhaps stated a little too bluntly (although the story does greatly showcase the themes, and this can be excused given the intended audience). I especially love how the movie is generally authentic to Korean culture, specifically the music and the mythology. The songs do an especially good job of being integrated into the story, as the characters are really singing them in each scene, which adds an element of emotion and purity to each number. They are also, of course, catchy and well written, so they are not only powerful but popular. The character development is strong, although I think some of the side characters are partly neglected in favor of the two leads. My only other complaint from my first time watching it was that the characters mouths did not seem to match up with the dialogue; I researched this, and although the movie was created in America and recorded in English, the characters were actually designed to move in Korean, which I think is an interesting and unique fun fact about the movie that integrates the culture just a tiny bit more (even though the visual effect is a little wonky at first). Overall, the film was funny, engaging, and worth the acclaim it has received.",4.5/5,"Sep 13, 2025",Positive
Cade C.,Audience,"I really liked this movie. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not much of a K-pop guy but the music in this movie was actually pretty good (and catchy). Story was pretty simple, not bad, definitely FUN. Plus funny, it had so many jokes in that film and I was just cracking up. Animation was CRISPER THAN CRISP THEMSELVES omg. I love these animators who have made several great films like Into-the Spider Verse. If you like music and good story, you’re going to love this for sure. Definitely a rewatch.",4/5,"Sep 13, 2025",Positive

Bradie D,Audience,"After the first time I watched it on Netflix, I proceeded to literally watch it again every single day for two weeks straight, then saw the sing along version in theatres, and then I've rewatched at least a half dozen times since then. I still notice something new every time because there are so many little details, and the emotional beats never get stale. And that's not even getting to the songs, which I've added to almost every Spotify playlist I have. They're just that good",5/5,"Sep 12, 2025",Positive

Not only do I have the soundtrack on repeat daily but watch the movies at least 2 times a day. Thank you to everyone that made this film possible, as it has made me look inward and reflect. Again I want to say thank you yo everyone that is truly something amazing that words can never express.",5/5,"Sep 10, 2025",Positive
Chang Yu Dennis L,Audience,"I thought since this was an anime movie i would not enjoy it, anime is for young kids, boy was i wrong. I love the comedy and the sisterhood experienced by each member of the group. Their songs are quite catchy also the Protagonist is another band corrupted by the demons they are hunting. I love how the lead singer is also part demon and is hesitant in destroying all demons, she wants to reform them instead of destroying them. They develop a song that will wipe out all demons but the Leader(Rumie) is hesitant in using it because she is also part demon she hides it instead of embracing it. She finally sings the song and destroy all the demons which in turn saves their souls. They need to do a live action of the movie. Their songs are catchy also, it sticks to your brain you find yourself humming the songs.",5/5,"Sep 9, 2025",Positive

Zsombor M,Audience,Yeah. Animated pieces are always hard on the message. And what a message it is! It made me wonder whether self acceptance is possible without the love of others.

Johann D. M,Audience,"A musical urban fantasy film that follows a K-pop girl group, Huntr/x, who lead double lives as demon hunters; they face off against a rival boy band, the Saja Boys, whose members are secretly demons. Although this is not typically my kind of film, I was pleasantly surprised by this musical gem. The soundtrack is irresistibly catchy and memorable—surely strong enough to secure at least one award nomination in the near future. The animation is equally dazzling, with infectious energy and a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors that make the film visually unforgettable. Its action sequences are fluid and dynamic, supported by camerawork that gives every scene a sense of momentum and purpose. The narrative, while predictable and somewhat formulaic, remains well-developed and engaging throughout. The songs never overstay their welcome, feeling precise, fun, and perfectly integrated into the story. Importantly, the film captures K-pop and K-drama culture with a level of authenticity rarely seen in cinema, making it a must-watch for fans of these genres. With its dazzling music, lively action, and cultural authenticity, it secures a spot as one of the most entertaining animated films of the year.",3.5/5,"Sep 8, 2025",Positive
Sloth D,Audience,"One of the best movies I have seen. Not just this year, but ever. I keep watching it, I have the sound track on all the time. If they had live shows with the singers from the movies I would be one of the first to get tickets! If they put this in theatres, I would pay to see it.

Sam T,Audience,"So, I am VERY late to this party. When it first came out, I had no idea and then my bsf convinced me to watch it, and…yeah, I can see why it’s so loved. It’s concepts like these that would never work in live action and could ONLY work in animation and I love that. Speaking of animation, once again, Sony absolutely hit the mark. They have really be excelling at creating different and unique. It’s not quite spiderverse but it has elements of that was the characters do look like something out of an anime but with a slight Disney effect? It’s super cool to look at and compliments the music. Going onto the music, it is top tier. It’s amazing. Dare I say it’s better than a lot of Disney musicals. They sound like something an actual band would make and not something a princess would sing in the moment about their feelings. The characters are also VERY well rounded. They all feel deep and rich. Rumi, Mira, and Zoey are all especially great. I only have a few critiques that I think hinder the movie slightly or could’ve been improved upon. First off, the comedy is great, but it does sometimes veer into “he’s right behind me, isn’t he?” territory, just jokes like that that do remind me that it’s a kids movie. Second, I don’t think there is enough of the big bad, Gwi-ma. He’s hyped up to be this big bad demon, but you don’t really get enough of a reason to really be afraid of him. Also, the movie does feel like it end a bit abruptly, like it’s missing another 20 minutes or so. Other than that, it’s a great movie. For sure a 9/10.",4.5/5,"Sep 7, 2025",Positive

Marc N,Audience,"This is how movies should be, original well written stories with recognizable characters. The story seems weird at first but the way it's told makes it make perfect sense relatively quickly. The storytelling and progression is very nicely paced, it has a good balance of calm moments but also epic action scenes. It also had some good plot twists built into it that kept me hooked and on the edge of my seat. The music is also incredible, it's nothing I would ever listen to on a daily basis, yet it alone was good enough to catch my attention. The music unintentionally drilled itself into my mind which ultimately made me wanna watch it, all songs (especially Golden) are so catchy and better than 99% of the Mainstream music nowadays. Hollywood take notes, stop with producing these endless prequel/sequel movies (like the MCU) and all the live-action slop (like Disney) and make Movies interesting again by making amazing original titles like this. This movie made me feel the way 10 year old me felt like 15 or so years ago when there were all these amazing animated movies like ''How to train your Dragon'', a feeling that I didn't have for a long time. Just a straight 10/10",5/5,"Sep 5, 2025",Positive

Sal A.,Audience,"No spoiler review: Great movie, it’s one that’s for both kids and adults. As the title suggests it’s K-pop with a demon hunting twist. I personally don’t like musicals but this movie doesn’t feel like a musical in the sense that musicals often feel like the songs are forced, this isn’t that, every song fits and progresses the story (and every song is very enjoyable). This is one of the movies with a deeper layer meaning and a positive message (while never talking down to any of the audience). It’s also a movie you will enjoy watching the second time just as much as the first. I made this account just to review this movie",4.5/5,"Sep 5, 2025",Positive

Sanjay K,Audience,L Evan S this movie is a W unlike you💀,5/5,"Sep 1, 2025",Positive
David A,Audience,"This trend in the animation industry of running 12 frames per second, creating gltichy and inconsistent image flow makes the movie unbearable. If I wanted to watch stop-motion I'd go back to the 80's/90's and watch Will Vinton. Instead I'm stuck watching garbage ""animation"" lazily doused in pop-idol music with a smattering of cultural Korean references to at the very least be seen as minimally representative. CGI peaked in the mid 2000's. This is the crap we're left with...",0.5/5,"Sep 1, 2025",Negative
alok J.,Audience,"As close to perfect as a film can get! Netflix/Sony has created a cultural phenomenon that our families will be singing for years to come. The film delivers from start to finish and is one of the rare films that is even better the second and third time it’s viewed. Thank heavens for Netflix, and their loyalty to their subscribers, or are family would be broke from box-office tickets, and if Saja Boys were real- our children would be begging for concert tickets. Parents, make no mistake from the title, this is not a film with evil intent, it’s an epic battle between right and wrong, and a pattern of overcoming what one is born into vs what can accomplish through redemption. Even with that compelling message, it still manages to deliver an unforgettable soundtrack and fun packed adventure people of all ages would be hard pressed to resist!",5/5,"Sep 1, 2025",Positive
James P,Audience,My girls watch the movie and listen to the music EVERYDAY and I don't mind it.,5/5,"Sep 1, 2025",Positive
Grace B,Audience,"An incredible watch for absolutely anyone and everyone. I've watched it with people who couldn't care less about kpop but thoroughly enjoyed it and are singing the songs all the time now. The story has a lot of beautiful complexity so adults will enjoy the emotional depth while kids can enjoy the bright and uplifting storyline. Incredible music, great animation technique, and a strong storyline.",5/5,"Sep 1, 2025",Positive
Ry R.,Audience,"9/10! My only problem with Kpop Demon Hunters is that it’s so fast paced! Like, you could never settle into a scene, but I guess they just wanted to make the movie cute, so yeah, it’s not bad.",4.5/5,"Sep 1, 2025",Positive

Ashe M,Audience,"Initially, I wasn't sure if I was going to like this - it seemed just too silly at first. But as the movie continued, I fell in love. I totally can relate to all three of the Huntrix members - Rumi having to hide herself, Zoey having to reign in the AuDHD, Mira having so many walls she seems like just a cold goth kid. And the songs are basically all bangers. I loved pulling into Sheetz with ""Golden"" blaring and having multiple people give me happy smiles and waves. Sadly, most of the bigger songs are waaaaay out of my current range, so I can't sing along easily.",5/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Positive

Michael School K,Audience,"lets split this Review into 2 sections first is Before watching: I thought this would be a cringe fest because Kpop idols being demon hunters secretly was ehhh Something. After Watching: ITS DEFINETLY MY ""SODA POP""",5/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Positive
Ruby P,Audience,"Oh my God. I watched this movie just to make fun of it and have watched it 9 times since. It is so good. There are so many good themes silently packed into this kids movie. Themes include shame, SH, manipulation, control, and generational trauma. So good. Also Jinu is really hot. RUJINU FOREVER ❤️❤️❤️ Definitely watch this movie.",5/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Positive
Jay W,Audience,"This movie really didn't have any marketing besides the title and word of mouth. And that was all the movie needed to become a hit. Even getting a short theatrical run after its Netflix premiere it still made over 18 million dollars in one weekend. The title is a bizarre enough combination that it really does sell itself. With loving the music, animation and humor, this should be a movie I love. Unfortunately, beyond the colorful wrapping, inside is a kids' movie formula that we have seen to death. By the 16-minute mark I knew exactly where the story was going. It plays all the greatest hits that I am just sick of. It is the ""just be yourself"" movie, combined with third act liar reveal drama that uses 10 minutes of the runtime moping. Yeah, I might be an overly snooty film critic. But like this movie teaches, I'm not going to hide that fact.",2.5/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Negative
Caoimhe B,Audience,"This has got to be one of the cringiest movies I’ve seen. The animation style is just awful. The storyline is not exactly quality writing. The songs are bad, painful listen. The entire plot is just so cheesy and makes me want to throw up if I’m being completely honest. I think it’s just a trend that people like it because it is completely overrated. The sing along on Netflix, part of the description is: ‘Ready to slay the day?’ Literally get out. Trying to make it fit Gen Z styles or whatever in a completely unsubtle way just make me physically cringe. Terrible movie wouldn’t recommend it.",1/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Negative
Clippy P,Audience,"Best movie of 2025! Music is FIRE, especially How It's Done and Free, and it blows 2010-2025 Disney music out of the water! The story kept me hooked from start to finish, the message is executed perfectly, and I love the characters! I expected it to be action-packed and funny, and it was, but it also got emotional at the climax. Sony was mad creative with KPDH.",4.5/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Positive
Punsara G,Audience,One of the best movies I have ever seen the animation is stunning and the songs are bangers and the character design is amazing and character and story depth is amazing and the themes explored like self acceptance and being black sheep and trying so hard and not accepted these themes explored are amazing how they able show kids around the world how being your true self and accepting your flaws is the right way to go and make it relatable for gen z teens and young adults and me personally would recommend its anybody its movie its a absolute must see an absoulte banger of a movie incredible job well done for Sony,5/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Positive

I loved the movie so much I watched it 2 times in a row, and normally I never watch animated movies! They did such a good job! They -I would give is that the have to make a second movie to go deeper in some plots! But seriously this movie is a much watch!",4.5/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Positive
Zac S,Audience,"It wasn’t bad but not good, had humour that only my mum laughed at, no cussing and only scary for maybe 5 unders",3/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Negative
Max W,Audience,"It was okay. There was so much going on in this movie at such a fast pace, that everything that was happening felt less substential. Some moments were really funny though and I especially enjoyed the scenes where music and action were combined - the initial jumping-out-of-plane scene gave me goose bumps. I just wish the deeper emotional themes were explored properly - felt like a bit of an insult to young people‘s intellects. Very much engineered for the dopamin addict mind.",3/5,"Aug 31, 2025",Negative

Pablo M.,Audience,"Judging by the tween girls and grown women screams during the K-POP Demon Hunters Sing Along event I took my daughter to this weekend, humanity would be cooked as a species if the Saja Boys were real because we would all fall in love worshipping this demon boy band.",5/5,"Aug 30, 2025",Positive

Quest -,Audience,"When I first saw the trailer for KPop Demon Hunters I was sceptical and wasn't really interested! However that being said. It's as colourful as Arcane League of Legends and as emotional as Frozen. My eyes were glued to this movie (an experience I haven't had for quite some time!) I found it fun and though it took some time Runi's hero journey was strong (Something that has been lacking in recent years!) It was great fun to watch and the music, though not my type the songs are pretty deaccent. I would say catchy but so were the ones from Frozen. I'd highly recommend this to anyone!",4/5,"Aug 30, 2025",Positive

The animation is the highlight of the film, and even had some anime kind of expresses on the characters, and I loved that!! And this movie definitely had some genuine moments that made me crack up!! I am really glad they're making a sequel, but ugh, no live action remake!! And as soon as they released it in theaters, it blew up so quick, and became the number one film in theaters!! That's really impressive!! What's even more impressive is that now it's the most watched film on Netflix, with over 200 million views!! I Am really happy for Netflix and Sony pictures!! Whatever you got next for the sequel, please cook!!👍 definitely worth the recommendation!! But as soon as I walk into high school, I already know I'm going to be listening to everyone listening to soda pop💀",5/5,"Aug 30, 2025",Positive

You get pulled in so fast you don’t even notice you’re 30 minutes deep, and then it flows so naturally you can’t help but enjoy every minute.

I really hope there’s more to come, because it made me feel like the good old days are making a comeback! :)",5/5,"Aug 30, 2025",Positive

Jason,Audience,"This movie hands down blew me away when it arrived on Netflix, my gf being a huge K-pop fan had asked me if I wanted to watch it and I was hesitant at first despite liking K-pop my self, something about it seemed like it could be boring or just not for me but boy was i wrong the animation style was severally top notch, the story was great enough to keep me drawn in the entire time, the action was also just badass. But the songs… the songs are all amazing, after the movie was done upon my first watch, the lady and I were streaming the songs non stop and were singing and dancing every time, *still are btw* but man was this movie amazing, definitely my favorite of 2025 and when we heard it was playing in theaters we had to get tickets.

Wyatt K.,Audience,"Certified Fresh Movies 1: Kpop Demon Hunters This is the first review for my “Certified Fresh Movies” review series, remember just because they are Certified Fresh, doesn’t mean they are always good (In my opinion). This movie is better than I expected it to be, the trailer made the movie look 50% absurd and 50% bad. The animation is great, it’s very funny, the third act was great, teaching people to forgive oneself. That’s all for today, my next movie for the “Certified Fresh Movies” series will be “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water”.",4/5,"Aug 28, 2025",Positive

But that doesn't stop me from loving the movie all round,5/5,"Aug 28, 2025",Positive
vs,Audience,"I liked the movie because it was interactive and a great way to enjoy the movie by singing along. However, I disliked a few girls who were there who were screaming at the top of their lungs making a obnoxious sounds.

Sosayweall j,Audience,"Fantastic Four was great, Superman was a complete knockout that singlehandedly will invigorate the DCU brand for years.. but KPop Demon Hunters is, despite it's kitschy-cringe name, absolute the movie of the summer--if not the year and maybe more. The fact that the original songs from the soundtrack attributed to fictional KPop acts have completely dominated the charts for weeks now, and that a super limited one-weekend theater run where the explicit goal was to have people who have ALREADY SEEN THE FILM MANY TIMES to shell out close to $20 a ticket each to see this movie on the big screen and turn their theaters into little concert venues, full-throatedly belting out the songs and laughing and crying in their seats. These are a testament to the movie's staying power and I for one hope this trend continues into the future. There's not enough I could say about this movie. It's hilarious, heavy, touching, and cathartic. It being a love-letter to all things Korean is core to the DNA of the film and yet it's also a beautiful cherry on top. This film, along with Netflix's Squid Games s1-3 have been contributing to a massive surge in interest of Korean culture and I couldn't be more here for it. I hope it spawns some more movies and that the creators and talent involved in this production are the ones given free reign to create the next one, whatever it is! 10000/10 time to go watch it again",5/5,"Aug 27, 2025",Positive

Zach W.,Audience,"Kpop Demon Hunters is currently the fourth most-watched film on Netflix ever, so I decided to give this a chance despite knowing practically nothing about K-Pop. To my surprise, Kpop Demon Hunters is an impressive film with vibrant, energetic animation and a charming soundtrack. While I am oblivious to the Korean cultural elements of Kpop Demon Hunters, I can definitely appreciate this film for its ambitiousness and stylish artistic creativity. In all honesty, I found the film to be overly childish at times, but Kpop Demon Hunters is undoubtedly a children’s film meant for children (so it’s hard to critique something for which I am clearly not the target audience). However, I did enjoy the playfulness of the story and the blend of song and music into the film. Kpop Demon Hunters does feel overly cluttered at times, but it could also very well be that I am unfamiliar with the cultural aspects of the film. Regardless, I had a rather good time with Kpop Demon Hunters and I was certainly never bored. Overall, Kpop Demon Hunters is proof that any story can thrive through animation as a medium. The stylishness of Kpop Demon Hunters is commendable and the musical aspects are a standout. The songs are catchy, the animation is bright and colorful, and the voice cast is immensely talented.",3/5,"Aug 26, 2025",Negative

Eddie Douglas S,Audience,"I liked ""K-Pop Demon Hunters"" because it has a great song, good acting, and even beat them with the demon band, the Saya Boys. It's a good movie from Sony Pictures Animation and Netflix. I'm going to give it a 100/100. What's good about this crew is that they're all crediting and sharing a lot about the process of the team. Being this transparent with fans is really good to understand there's real person behind a movie. And in this case, how much effort they made to represent Korean culture. ♥️ It's very good, I recommend it to all fans who recognize Korean culture, the bands Huntrix and the Saya Boys.♥️ And it's very popular those singers Rumi, Mira and Zoey are the top #1 of the best popular Netflix movies of all time.",5/5,"Aug 25, 2025",Positive
Alfie R,Audience,"This has became a new comfort movie for me. I'll be honest I now listen to the movies soundtrack because I don't know how but along with the stellar animation style of ""Spider-Man Into/Across the Spiderverse"" (like seriously Sony Pictures keep it up, you're no.1) it also has a near perfect catchy soundtrack where everything doesn't feel like an overplayed pop song (like with whatever Disney and everyone else is doing now). Not only that but it takes some ballsy creative decisions but also hits the mark on EVERY SINGLE ONE. The romance is great and really has fun while not being obvious with it. The movie has an amazing message too. I would even go so far as to say this movie... is a modern masterpiece.",5/5,"Aug 25, 2025",Positive

Alex D.,Audience,"The humor definitely is written catering to millennials like as if we were watching a cooler version genre of Shrek while leaning on a more modern and popular theme in kpop. That dry/sarcastic sense of humor proves its best while not being overly cringy. This movie could’ve came out anywhere between 2000-2013 and would’ve been just as popular. It’s a sad reflection of today’s generation’s lack of creativity & storytelling. Why not combine popular movie genres together like action, music and comedy? It almost felt like a blend of The Avengers meet a musical..it just works so well.",5/5,"Aug 25, 2025",Positive

My daughter is well into Japan / Korea etc and this was expected for her to love. My son loves Pokemon so this was an unexpected twist that he is obsessed. The music is phenomenal - every big track is out of this world. I went into it with no expectations and came out sobbing at ‘this is what is sounds like’. The female representation is wicked. Munching, sarcasm, ugly crying, friendship, neurodivergency, strength, rage … it’s perfect. The visuals are amazing. If I could rate it 10 starts I would. I beg there’s a number 2.",5/5,"Aug 25, 2025",Positive

Scott W,Audience,"This movie is better than it has any right to be. Easy recommendation if you have Netflix. Would be worth signing up for a month to give it a watch. Great animation, surprisingly strong, relatable, and deals with mature topics, but like all the best Pixar movies, it’ll have themes that resonate with adults and children. Almost published this without talking about the music.. incredible talent.. listen I’m not a KPOP guy… this soundtrack is sitting comfortably in my library. This movie is worth every second of your time. Petition to have this movie not tagged as kids movie on Netflix 🙄",5/5,"Aug 25, 2025",Positive

Trae G.,Audience,"Directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans deliver a masterpiece of great songs and a even greater time in this better than expected film. Y’all better believe the hype that been surrounding this film for a few months it’s so much fun and charming and continuing to prove why Sony Pictures Animation is becoming an incredible studio and Netflix has a real true must see movie on its platform. The voice performances from both the regular and vocal actors are amazing throughout the whole film with those of Arden Cho, Ahn Hyo-seop and the singing performance of Ejae being the real standouts of the movie! The songs are amazing, sound great, incredible catchy and well written and had people all throughout my sing along version I was in singing throughout and will definitely be listening to them for a while. The animation is masterful and feels like both of the Spider Verse film in all the best ways and I love how it seamlessly combines elements of 3D computer animation and anime style animation so effortlessly. It’s the easiest recommendation I’ve had in a while and an absolute must see for everyone!",5/5,"Aug 24, 2025",Positive

David T,Audience,"Kpop Demon Hunter is a dazzling blend of action, laughter, and music that manages to captivate audiences of all ages. The film’s colorful energy, heartfelt moments, and creative storytelling make it irresistible for kids, while the humor and sleek production keep adults equally hooked. Most impressive of all is the soundtrack, a dazzling mix of beats and melodies that feels instantly addictive. It’s no surprise fans report playing these songs on repeat again and again. Kpop Demon Hunter is more than just a movie, it’s an all-around experience that leaves you wanting to hit the replay button immediately.",5/5,"Aug 24, 2025",Positive
Brandon P,Audience,"I went in knowing nothing. Parts of it moved well and I enjoyed, but then it quickly became apparent that while I thought this was a story about 3 female demon hunters, it was about 1 of them and a demon. The love story kept taking me out of the stories that seemed far more interesting. I felt like I went to watch a Disney movie when I had thought I was going to see something else. That is not the film's fault, I went in knowing nothing and thinking something that it wasn't. In the end, while I could find enjoyment at times, I felt like the movie dragged on for a lot of it. There is a fandom out there for it, and I love that this is there for them. I am just not one of that fandom.",3/5,"Aug 24, 2025",Negative
N/A,Audience,"The best animated movie I have seen in a while. A few reasons why is that the animation always was great, the songs are breaking records, and the whole movie itself. There are a lot of hidden stuff in the movie that made me want to know more about it, or it was a perfect detail, and the story made sense and had a very unexpected twist. Overall 10/10",5/5,"Aug 24, 2025",Positive
Dwayne M,Audience,"It is just so well animated, written, and the music is amazing. We even watched it in theaters this past weekend. I NEVER pay to watch a movie in theaters after watching it for ""Free"" but my son loved it (he watched it at least 3 times) I really wanted to hear the music in theaters, so when I found it was coming to theaters for this weekend, I was the one that kept looking for the tickets to go on sale (and my wife bought us all shirts...). It was worth seeing in theaters! PS: Seeing this made me re-watch the 2 spider-verse movies. I even VPNed to Canada to watch the first one.",5/5,"Aug 24, 2025",Positive
Francesco A.,Audience,"K-Pop Demon Hunters: A Sing-Along Event (2025) This was fun. I was able to catch this in theaters during the limited two-day Sing-Along Event, and I’m glad I did. The atmosphere was electric—lots of positive vibes and excitement. The auditorium would come alive with singing, and at times the audience even quoted lines from the movie in unison. That kind of communal energy was just fun to be part of. Whoever came up with this idea at Netflix and Sony Pictures Animation made a brilliant move. I’d already enjoyed this at home on Netflix, but watching it on the big screen with a crowd was a whole different experience. It’s a great reminder of how special the theatrical experience can be. This is a true testament to the magic of the cinematic experience—sharing a movie on the big screen with an audience. The movie itself really shines on the big screen. The animation is awesome, the story is cool and unique, the characters are fun and enjoyable, the humor lands throughout, and the music is as catchy as ever. If you’re interested, it’s definitely worth catching on the big screen on its last day.",4/5,"Aug 24, 2025",Positive

Lasse L,Audience,"The film looks great and is probably at its best as a musical. The story isn't particularly original, though, and I don't think the worldbuilding is well-integrated with the K-pop setting. The action is window dressing; there's no dramatic weight behind it.",2.5/5,"Aug 24, 2025",Negative
Brenden D,Audience,"One Of The Best Animated Films Of The 2020's The Animation Is Of A Similar Style To & On The Same Level As Spiderverse & Mutant Mayhem. The Music Is Phenomenal & Catchy. The Choreography For Both The Musical Performances & The Fights With The Demons Are Absolutely Solid. The Themes Of Shame & Acceptance Are Perfectly Catpured Through Metaphors & Brialliant Story Telling. The Voice Acting Is Top Notch & Emotional Elements Hit Hard. It Leaves Me Wanting To Watch It Over And Over. This Film Is ABOSULTELY GOLDEN A 9.5/10 A Must Watch For Everyone, Even If You're Not A K Pop Fan",5/5,"Aug 24, 2025",Positive

emilysclone L,Audience,"How did Sony not see this making money when they made their contract with Netflix? Seriously, just, HOW?! Okay, I am going to go through all of this to explain what worked and the few flaws it does have. (don’t look at me like that, every movie/show has them.) First is the animation style. Like Spider Verse it’s full CG but with jittery low frame rate that mimic stop motion. 100% honest here, I hate this style with a passion, that’s the reason it took me so long to watch this. The whole point of CG is to animate faster with more fluid movements than hand drawn. Doing movies in this style defeats the purpose and makes the whole thing look like it hasn’t rendered properly, annoying the heck out of me. That’s just a personal pet peeve of mine so I won’t let it effect my review of the movie. The art style itself is great for the story. Not too realistic but cartoonish enough to show the strong range of expressions the characters posses. Sometimes it does go a bit far, corn cob eyes and bean mouths come to mind, but these moments are rare enough that I can look past it. The characters themselves are the perfect balance of simple design but complex personality. They even drop the trope of keeping characters in the same costume and have the girls constantly change outfits, even their makeup changes. I will be very surprised if there aren’t any kids dressed as characters from this movie for Halloween. The only character design I have an issue with is the villain Gwi-Ma. He’s a giant neon pink fiery fart cloud and that’s it. His minions at least eat souls with claws and fangs making them more intimidating, but all I can see Gwi-Ma doing is burning your marshmallows while laughing maniacally. There was an idea that was cut out of him appearing as a giant demon at the final concert but this was scrapped for some reason. The plot does sound unusual at first but it’s unique enough to make even skeptics give it a look if done right, which, thankfully, it was. The story is told very well but does have a point or two that could have been done better. The biggest one is their mentor Celine. She doesn’t need to be in the movie since her part is so small it’s almost non existent. Her only purpose is for backstory and that’s taken care of in the intro and a short flashback. Her scene towards the end could have been cut and the story would go on as usual. Another idea that was cut was for Celine to have killed Rumi’s parents, her mother for being a traitor and her father for being a demon, but this would have been better if they kept it in. Not only would Celine have more significance to making Rumi act the way she does but her character would have made for an unintentional background villain in the girls story. The bird and the cat were made just to have animal plushie sales, they have no other purpose but I get it. Every kid flick needs a cute animal companion character. The voices and music are what sell the whole thing. The VA’s do a wonderful job bringing the characters to life and the songs….what can I even say? The music slams, and this is coming from someone who hates anything that sounds like rap music but even I love the opening song. We get to see the difference in both groups styles perfectly. Huntr/x songs come from the heart with emotional lyrics while Saja Boys are generic boy band songs. Both catchy but only one has heart. I did get left with a lot of questions. How were they chosen to become hunters? What happened to the half of the plane they abandoned at the start of the movie? Why were people physically disappearing after their souls were taken? Do people like those in the bath house see a group of Kpop girls running around swinging at nothing since they apparently can’t see the demons? Questions we don’t get answered but the movie still works. I would have gladly sat through another 30 – 45 minutes of story if it fixed the few issues the movie had but even without the fixes, it’s still a fun movie with a fantastic soundtrack. Take notes Disney! Maybe you can learn something!!!!",4.5/5,"Aug 24, 2025",Positive

Daniel S,Audience,"Visually, K-pop Demon Hunters is unapologetically stylized. Fight scenes flow like music videos, with flashy lighting, neon backdrops, and even synchronized combat that feels like dance routines. At first it might seem gimmicky, but it works.

N/A,Audience,"THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!! It’s so bad that it became one of my sacred movies. Like WHY is it so addicting? I LITERALLY WATCHED IT LIKE 60 TIMES OR SOMETHING?? That’s a bad sign, right?? Well… yes and no. Let’s cut the joke—it’s a cliché one anyway. The movie truly gave me an extraordinary feeling, the kind of feeling that I, and maybe millions of others, always long for. The feeling of letting go of all the embarrassing, shameful, and heavy things that anchor us down, keeping us stuck in one place, and making us believe we can’t reach what we yearn for. Kpop Demon Hunters (KDH) told us to keep fighting despite our flaws and to keep believing that we will all reach the “Golden” point at some moment in our lives. I used to come to RT just to criticize movies, but this time I only came here to appreciate everyone who worked on this film. Thank you so much for this masterpiece. Also, a huge thanks to the music production teams—the lyricists, composers, singers! The three amazing humans with absolutely golden voices: EJAE, Rei Ami, and Audrey Nuna! You’re all incredible! Sorry if this review sounds more like something I’d tell a psychiatrist. But I guess that’s how you know a movie is truly impactful and incredible. This movie came out of nowhere—suddenly appearing on my screen on a random day. At first, I ridiculed it for its name (and yes, it’s still a silly title even now). But… this won’t affect its score. It’s rare for me to give a movie 5/5 stars, so I consider this a kind of sacred award. Massive congratulations to this film. I honestly expect both Academy and Grammy recognition for this movie. And Sony, this is your loss for not releasing it on the big screen. For everyone still doubting this film: please, you need to watch it at least once in your lifetime. There are so many other things I haven’t even mentioned that are just as incredible. I truly believe you’ll like it, no matter your age or level of maturity.",5/5,"Aug 23, 2025",Positive

ivy M,Audience,"In my opinion: It's good, but not great (coming from someone who's rewatched this movie multiple times.) I feel like the movie should've either A. Been longer, or B. been a series, as it feels like a LOT of characters were underdeveloped and didn't have enough time to be fleshed out. Rumi and Jinu feel like the only characters to actually get development while everyone else is shoved to the side, and in general the plot feels like it could've been more, that the MOVIE could've been more. That said, there are a lot of good things about this movie, and I totally understand why people love it. The animation is stellar, obviously, I like how they just let the main 3 Huntr/x girls be themselves without focusing on making them too ""ugly"" or ""weird,"" the music is great, Derpy and the bird are really adorable, I liked Rumi and Jinu's dynamic, and all around the movie isn't bad by any means. I just feel like there could've been so much more they could've done with it, and like I said I wish it was longer or a 2D animated series. But honestly, if you love this movie, I completely get why and hopefully I'll like the upcoming 2 sequels planned more.",3/5,"Aug 23, 2025",Negative
Aiden M,Audience,I find this movie ok but my niece loves it so had to watch it for a review. and its a good movie and it has plot and development I just don't think it's the greatest thing ever but the younger kids love it and I had a few good laughs.,4/5,"Aug 23, 2025",Positive
Mikah M,Audience,"In the age where modern cinema cares more about creating a franchise rather than a good movie, K-Pop Demon Hunters comes out as something innovative, creative and absolutely stunning. The story is fresh and unique with a world that I found fun and enjoyable. The characters were as colourful and vibrant as the animation. Voice acting that was performed extremely well that you could tell that they had put their hearts into this project. It could have been a corny animated film made for kids like trolls but instead they made a masterpiece that was fun for all ages and sets a great standard for future animated films.",5/5,"Aug 23, 2025",Positive

David G,Audience,"Sooo is Zoey just Peni Parker from a different universe where she didn't get bitten by a radioactive spider and had a good singing voice? Very strange, Sony. Wow, this movie's good. I never planned on watching this movie. I am not a KPop or anime-like-animation person AT ALL. But I wanted to see what all the hype is about. Is it really that good? Yes, yes it is. Holy carp, the animation had no right being as good as it is. If you show the first scene of them eating on the plane, talking to their fans, then fighting demons to anyone who likes animation, they will immediately drop everything they're doing and go watch this movie. If you didn't like anything about this movie other than the animation, I bet you'd still give it a 3/5. I could sing the animation's praises til the day I die. The music is sooooo good as well. Each singer in this movie has the most amazing voice ever, and they hit their notes perfectly every time (except for Rumi, of course, but that's on purpose). This movie does not waste time with boring exposition. They give you like one or two small flashbacks, and you're able to fill everything else in yourself. Overall, the plot is great, the animation is AMAZING, this singing is golden (pun intended), and there's a great message to be learned. This movie deserves to be talked about in the same breath as Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Spider-Verse, and Mitchells vs. The Machines. KPop Demon Hunters absolutely deserves to be seen in theaters, and it brings me joy to see that most of the showings are selling out. This film is my personal favorite to win Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, so far. Sony, you've hit it out of the park once again!!!",4.5/5,"Aug 20, 2025",Positive

Kyle M,Audience,"Even if the music sensation isn’t in your frequent playlist, including the associative visual appeals to signify its distinctive quirk, it’s charming and fun enough with a decent heart to evoke formulaic resonance amid complex theming enthusiastically performed and animated from a renowned webby cloth to establish a compellingly creative lore.

Lorenzo I,Audience,"""K-pop Demon Hunters"" is an electrifying and brilliantly executed concept. The vocals are stunning and the compelling story of battling inner demons works really well. Visually, the members are breathtakingly realistic and the action sequences are cinematic and sleek, setting a new bar for virtual idol performances. It’s a perfect, adrenaline-pumping movie that proves innovation and great music can go hand-in-hand",5/5,"Aug 20, 2025",Positive
Alexander R,Audience,"Beautifully animated story that steers clear of the modern tropes plaguing Hollywood. The music production is also top-notch, with incredible vocal performances and excellent production quality that will have you humming your way back home after the movie’s over—and wanting more. The story doesn’t veer too far from traditional tropes and archetypes, but it executes them well. The pacing is solid, using its lean runtime effectively with a mix of action sequences, musical numbers, and character beats. Overall, a breath of fresh air in a world of stale remakes and sequels.",5/5,"Aug 20, 2025",Positive

N/A,Audience,"1.5/5 I watched it because I heard a lot about it online , but it turned out to be overhyped , The movie is mid and maybe worse , It's mostly for k pop fans and teenage girls the songs are so annoying especially for people who don't usually listen to k pop music and the facial expressions are very cringe but the fights were good and the story was just random and full of plot holes and all the characters are the same trying to be funny but they're not and they are all so strong and the writer trying to make them deeper than they seem but it just doesn't work and there's no explanation about the demons or what they want or why are they're there they're just evil and the ending was so rushed and the message that girls can do anything it's just boring and it's for no reason existing in the movie, overall it's just an overhyped k pop movie by its fans it's not for everyone but you might enjoy it if u under the age of 14",1.5/5,"Aug 20, 2025",Negative

Jamie W,Audience,"This just works. I'm sure it's original audience certainly wasn't me, but it just hits the spot that I didn't realise I needed. It's a mixture of throughtful and joyful storytelling, well voice acted characters, superb animation and visuals.

Seneca V,Audience,Fun for people of all ages for sure with humor. If you love kpop the movie has a lot of fun Easter eggs and references too! Also the songs are ALL FIRE!!! (you can stream on any streaming service). I have definitely found this to be a refreshing movie in the midst of many remakes. The cast is also stacked.,5/5,"Aug 19, 2025",Positive
Sandrea S,Audience,"My actual rating would be 5/10 but I did feel the need to lower the mean just marginally. This movie is definitely just a kid's movie with an insanely high budget. A lot of fans will claim that it has a lot of deep symbolism in it, and while I won't completely disagree, I feel as though all of its commentary about the kpop industry is obvious enough to fans already into kpop and will completely fly over non-kpop fans' heads. The plot is straightforward, which is definitely not a bad thing in itself, but it's so utterly predictable and strangely cliché? For someone who was baited by the sheer hype this movie got, I genuinely believed reviewers who called this story 'subversive'. There is absolutely nothing unique about Kpop Demon Hunters. (SPOILERS WARNING HERE ON OUT) Rumi herself is a half demon, which is revealed in pretty much the first ten minutes of the movie. While I was watching it, I tried to ignore the immediate ick it gave me as I found it very reminiscent of a gacha club video, thinking the plot was going to progress in a way that wasn't cringe. That didn't happen, of course; Huntrix encounters a boy group that turns out to be demons trying to draw attention away from Huntrix to unleash the apocalypse or whatever, and the most normal-looking and conventionally handsome member of the Saja Boys, Jinu, takes an interest in Rumi. Why wouldn't he? They were both fated to forbidden love from the get-go. He has a sad backstory, the leads feel an emotional connection when they meet up for their secret rendezvous, they fall in love, he betrays her and then dies for her in the end in the most predictable way you can think of. (There's definitely going to be a second movie, and Jinu is ABSOLUTELY going to come back alive. I already predicted it because that's how this crap always goes.) They have ZERO chemistry too- say what you want to say about shipping them, but they were one of the most bland vanilla-scented white bread-esque couples I had ever witnessed. The side characters are very flat. I thought Mira was going to get more development because the movie opens with her screentime and she's kind of cool, or at least cooler than the Y/N slot we call the main character. Imagine my utter disappointment when I realised her character gets no exploration through the entire movie when the ending credits played. Mira and Zoe are one unit because Rumi absolutely has to be as centred as possible. They're her sidekicks, so why wouldn't they just be her supporters? And neither of them actually have love interests either. The dialogue is horrible. I mean, it's a kid's movie, and dialogue is meant to be disgustingly digestible, but that won't stop me from criticising it anyway. Absolutely horrible. So utterly cringe and painful to listen to. The songs are also average at best. I hate them but I guess they sound like kpop songs so I'll try to be fair. They're not catchy- fans only think they are because the media hypes them up so much that the songs are EVERYWHERE and it sort of drills into your brain after a while. When I first watched the movie I forgot how the songs sounded but because I found them all over my FYP I was forced to listen to it over and over again. I could definitely go on about everything I loathe about this movie, but I'll stop there and talk about why it's still a 5/10 at the end of the day. The animation is great, I like the ugly facial expressions the female characters make that are quite rare, the action scenes are spectacular, and I feel that this movie still has potential. Most of the bad things I pointed out are very much possible to correct in the second movie, such as side character development and a more nuanced plot, so I'll probably be there to watch the second movie as well.",0.5/5,"Aug 19, 2025",Negative
Hunt E,Audience,"TLDR: Its a great family friendly kids/teens musical. More mature than Descendants but nothing too crazy. Its a fun comfy watch, but doesn't reinvent the wheel. This movie is as a whole, pretty great. There's nothing really to give major criticism to, but I'm very critical of animated movies since I really enjoy them. The music is really pretty good, I'd take Golden or Soda Pop over Let it Go any day. My Nitpicks: This movie would have been SO much better 2D animated. It tries so hard to be 'Anime' and just comes across as a pale imitation. The Art style unfortunately treads into ""grubhub commercial"" animation like 'Turning Red', but when the art direction gets to be itself instead of trying to be anime or disney, it really has some gorgeous scenes. The entire finale is a really gorgeous eye candy, especially for CG animation. But any time they tried to do the ""silly anime faces"" it came across as ugly instead of funny. A small nitpick is that the girls really lack an evolution of their visual style, never take down their hair even when in pajamas or the bath, never really visually evolve. We're very much told they've changed but in the artistic direction they're the same as the movie started. Theres a lot of stuff thats just told to the audience instead of shown, or shown with narration. I know its a kids movie but it could have used more of the character evolution shown on screen rather than told. The plot is simple yet solid, there are some things I'm confused about especially as the movie adds to the world's lore, particularly around the act of ""Sealing the Honmoon"" and how impactful that event is. In later scenes its treated like the final battle against the demons and Rumi's only hope for normalcy, but its also implied they seal it every year and it holds long enough for the girls to get a little break. As a whole, its a fun movie, but take the hype with a grain of salt before you go in.",3.5/5,"Aug 19, 2025",Positive

Jordan S,Audience,"I was incredibly skeptical going into this but I was impressed by this movie. As someone who doesn’t listen to kpop in any way shape or form, I enjoyed the music in this movie a lot. The artstyle was also phenomenal. It managed to capture the appeal of the animation from the spider-verse movies, but it set itself apart from those movies with its own artistic direction.

The story could've been longer and not rushed but it's still really amazing. It is very rewatchable, and I can't stop listening to the soundtrack.

Peter sebastian galang manalad M,Audience,"Great story, characters and animation.",5/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Positive
Angelo C.,Audience,"It’s AMAZING with the Songs and Cast but for sing-along no was kind of singing, and I was glad because I didn’t want no one to sing and stuff cause for movies with sing-alongs like I don’t want people to sing the songs out loud and because the movie is supposed to be quiet and we watch like that be excited and fearful and sad and the songs are catchy",4/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Positive
Liam M,Audience,"If you have not seen this, you have not seen the absolute cinema classic of the Kpop demon hunters. The songs and story are better than any music producers or screen writers could do in the last 5 or 10 years. The animation of this film does not hinder this film. People should not critize it for being animated as it is emotional, light hearted and fun in any setting and even after my 4th watch I am still singing along and having the time of my life. This film is atleast the top 10 films of ALL time. If you haven't seen it, Then you haven't awoken into the 21st century art of film making.",5/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Positive
Alexandre G,Audience,I only gave this a three and a half star is because the music SLAPS. I think that they spent too much time on the music and thus making the movie super cringy. Def worth a watch tho. Or just download the soundtrack.,3.5/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Positive
Alex Raphael C,Audience,"Story is really predictable, but let's face it, you're not here for the story. You're here for the songs and beats that will be in your ear for the next 6 months. By the first song, you will be bobbing your head and shoulders. I just feel that Sony needs to release this in theaters near Halloween season and just cash in on the costumes! Animation is fantastic. I don't know why it reminds me also of power puff girls, but it's actually that, it's the kpop version of Power Puff Girls! With Bobby as the professor. Hahaha",4.5/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Positive

Nicholas G,Audience,"KPop Demon Hunters is a visual and musical treat that takes you on a wild ride through a world inspired by K-pop, anime, and the Spider-Verse. The animation is so colorful and creative that it’s like a kaleidoscope explosion! The music is catchy and upbeat, and the story is layered with depth and emotion. Arden Cho and the rest of the voice cast do amazing jobs bringing the characters to life. The main character, Rumi, is on a journey of self-discovery, and it’s really heartwarming to see how much they grow and learn. The film does have a few minor flaws, like some uneven tones and underdeveloped secondary characters, but overall, it’s a fun and entertaining fantasy parody of pop culture. It’s a must-watch for anyone who loves K-pop, anime, and just great storytelling.",4/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Positive
Secret S,Audience,"Slow dooown. The main characters are a bit too slobbish at times, but that's less of an issue when they're being humiliated. I wonder if this film was helped or hurt by Princession Orchestra.",2.5/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Negative
Emerson H,Audience,"When the trailers came out, we all thought this was gonna be awful, and we would all , feel bad for the poor critics who had to sit down and watch it just to give a first review, and I can gladly say, after it being out for nearly 2 months, I finally sat down and watched it. I can confirm this movie is actually really good, I mean, no one expected this to be a global phenomenon, there is no way it is worth 97% on R.T., in my opinion, it is worth an 8.6/10",4/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Positive
Patrick G,Audience,"One of those weird banger type movies, Sony Animation Studio keeps pumping these random animated bangers and I love it.",4/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Positive

Mad,Audience,"When I first saw the title, I cringed. “They must be running out of ideas,” I thought. No way was I got to watch something so stupid. Then, weeks later, the bsf hits me with the recommendation and instantly I knew… I was wrong. This girl never lets me down with her recommendations. I put it on immediately. Two minutes in, I rewind it and call my roommate over to watch. We went on the most epic, visually and audibly beautiful adventure and fell in love with some demons along the way. I cannot recommend it more. P.S. It was supposed to be a 3hr long movie but Netflix made them cut it down and we lost the kiss scene.",5/5,"Aug 17, 2025",Positive

MoonLight X,Audience,"When I started watching this film I was expecting something good and entertaining, but to my surprise it was so much good and very entertaining. Sony did a great job animating this movie, especially with the silly faces. The music was the main element of the movie, and they nailed it. The lyrics were good, and the tune was beautiful to hear. Overall this movie was fun, and there were not any boring scenes, The pace was balanced and good.",3.5/5,"Aug 16, 2025",Positive
Michaela S,Audience,"Definitely recommend this movie. When I first heard the title I'll admit I was iffy about it and I didn't watch it when it came out, fast forward a few weeks beginning of July and friends of mine were raving about it so I figured why not...my only mistake is not watching it sooner. I loved this movie. The songs are bangers, the animation is astonishing, the story was well written. It hit me in the feels and I experienced all kinds of emotions while watching. It's amazing how much talent went into this movie and it's something I think everyone should see. Definitely my top movie of the year by far. It may have been a movie made for kids, but it's expanded beyond that, and even still, it made my inner kid at heart very happy.",5/5,"Aug 16, 2025",Positive
Lit D.,Audience,It’s so good and the music is fire🔥🔥🔥🔥,3.5/5,"Aug 16, 2025",Positive
N/A,Audience,Even the word perfection is not even strong enough to describe this masterpiece. It’s a hell of a great ride. I can’t believe Disney is not capable of delivering us something great again like this movie. Literally all the characters are my favourites. The passion the writers and the voice actors sends to us is heartwarming. It’s been a month and I can’t stop rewatching and relistening to the album. I even harass my brothers and some of my friends to watch it.,5/5,"Aug 16, 2025",Positive

Calvin G,Audience,"Super fun movie with a great soundtrack and original songs (can't get soda pop or golden out of my head) while it sorta falls flat with its not-so-funny kiddie humor, it is a fun watch overall",4/5,"Aug 16, 2025",Positive
Jordan S.,Audience,"Amazing, songs are fantastic, story is interesting and new. Funny, exciting, and the songs are so unique!!",5/5,"Aug 15, 2025",Positive
Nona L,Audience,"Cute feel good movie for kids. The songs are really nice for the movie and plot itself otherwise they're jarring. Plot is kind of basic, but I didn't expect something too complex. Animation is suprisingly ugly and not fluid. Overhyped",1.5/5,"Aug 15, 2025",Negative
Jaykeb G,Audience,"Kpop Demon Hunters sounded like a concept i thought I was going to dislike, but I actually found it to be very intriguing. This i feel is definitely going to turn into a multi movie franchise, and I feel it rightfully deserves it. It’s got a great set of characters, an extremely creative animation style , and a soundtrack that immediately becomes iconic. It did take me a small chunk of time to finally get into the story, and the pacing was too quick for my liking, but I’m excited to see where this movie goes forward, and I recommend watching it on Netflix",3.5/5,"Aug 15, 2025",Positive

Samantha F,Audience,"When I first heard of ""K pop demon hunters"" i wrote it off as a childs movie that would probably suck and be cringey But when I watched it I became obsessed. The music is amazing. The visuals are fun but not overstimulating. They managed to make a perfect balance of seriousness and cartoonish fun. Had me almost crying by the end of it. Highly recommended movie",5/5,"Aug 15, 2025",Positive

Isaiah L,Audience,"I really didn't think this movie would be fire. I really didn't believe my cousin or my aunt at all. I was just like it was probably some little girl movie. But man, this movie is a masterpiece. It's so fire quirky, and has all of it. I love it and has lots of heart.",5/5,"Aug 15, 2025",Positive
Jude H,Audience,"I wasn't really into KPop before this movie came out, well, times change. The animation is great, so is the story. But the music is what sells me on this movie. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because the passing in the last 15 minutes is kinda weird and rushed, but don't let that ruin the fact that we have a good original animated movie in 2025.",4.5/5,"Aug 15, 2025",Positive
Maja K,Audience,"The only disappointment this movie gave me is that it wasn’t released in theaters. The music, animation, humor and AGAIN MUSIC are excellent.",5/5,"Aug 15, 2025",Positive
Time2643,Audience,"This movie is amazing. Not only with the catchy music that will have you scrambling for Spotify to add to your Playlist, but you will want to see this movie over and over, again and again. It's a one-off movie, but it'll leave you wanting more. After seeing this movie, you WILL want to make your own song videos from the movie. It's THAT good!",5/5,"Aug 14, 2025",Positive

R J,Audience,"The songs were great and animation, but the movie was okay. Amazing animation choreography and excellent voice acting. However, most characters felt flat. There wasn’t much development and when there was, there were many moments that contradicted that development. Outside of that, sometimes the plot felt messy or boring or too pushed out and sudden. But I understand that this movie is more directed for a younger audience and those who like kpop, so it wasn’t the worst.",3/5,"Aug 14, 2025",Negative

Justin M.,Audience,Fun movie! Great songs. Great story overall worth the watch!,5/5,"Aug 14, 2025",Positive
Rob W,Audience,"Such a refreshing original IP movie that you can sit down and watch with the kids. The only problems were some pacing issues, particularly in the last act - it could have easily handled an extra 30-40 minutes of runtime. Celine not getting a song hurt a little - maybe producers not wanting to run risks and forcing a shorter runtime - maybe it was hard to make the extra content work. Overall it's a good thing to be left wanting more. I'd love to see a director's extended edition, a prequel and a sequel from this IP provided the quality doesn't drop - particularly the songs. Incredible work. Amazing talent.",5/5,"Aug 14, 2025",Positive

Karin S,Audience,"La verdad es que vi esta película con cero expectativa. Solo porque mis hijas me insistieron. No me tincaba para nada. De monitos, de k pop, de cazadoras de demonios … nop definitivamente estaba segura que me iba a aburrir, pero por lo menos iba a pasar un tiempo con mis hijas (12 y 14 años). Para mi sorpresa …. Me fascinó! Súper entretenida, rápida, sin tiempos lateros donde usualmente me duermo (me dormí en little mermaid, snowwhite, trolls 🫣). Amé pero recontra me encantaron las canciones pegajosas! La voz principal de Huntrix realmente espectacular (en inglés por favor, miren que verla en español latino es horrorosa la traducción y las y los cantantes no llegan a ser tan buenos como en inglés). Ahora ya tengo mis entradas al cine para ir con mis hijas al Sing Along el sábado 23 de agosto. ❤️",5/5,"Aug 13, 2025",Positive

Tanner G,Audience,"Alright, so this movie might seem ridiculous at first glance, but this exceeded my expectations in so many ways. True, the first 10 minutes were very cringe-worthy, this movie has a powerful message of teamwork and honesty. the music is also fire.",4.5/5,"Aug 13, 2025",Positive
Courtney W,Audience,I am a metal head so I don’t really listen to this kind of music this movie has and because of that I was really hesitant to watch at first. But after seeing it all over social media I thought why not give it a try. And to be honest I’m glad I did. The characters and story line is completely captivating with actual elements of culture in there it’s clear developers have done research and know the culture well. It’s so well animated and to be truthful the music isn’t too bad I really enjoyed it actually. Due to the fact I listen to Pantera I’m sure that alone speaks volumes about the movie and its soundtrack. Definitely give it a watch,5/5,"Aug 13, 2025",Positive

Ben W,Audience,"KPop Demon Hunters gives off some very good (and catchy) vibes. As a 15 year old, I thought I wouldn't be the target audience, yet I found myself bopping along to the songs and having a good time. Wouldn't say it's worth all the hype but is definitely worth a watch.",3.5/5,"Aug 13, 2025",Positive
Tobi R,Audience,"I literally recommend this to everyone I meet. The action is fast paced. The songs are all bangers- literally not a flop in the entire soundtrack, which is rare for me.

Jonathan M,Audience,"(2 boys; 10 and 4) This was a pretty solid movie. I'm glad I heard about it via word of mouth, because based on the title, I never would have watched this having two boys. But they both thoroughly enjoyed it, and my 4 year old was singing the songs by the end of hearing them for the first time. My 10 year old also liked the songs and was invested in the story. As for the parent; this is exactly what you want from a kids movie; good storytelling, and good enough jokes where you should be entertained along with the kids. A great family movie that doesn't skimp on story because it's a ""kids"" movie (I hate that people think kids movies should be dumb. Or children deserve well-crafted stories too).",4.5/5,"Aug 13, 2025",Positive
Veronica,Audience,It is a MUST see and i genuinely don’t know a single person who has seen this movie and has not liked it. The music is fabulous and everything abt the dialogue just hits so deep.

Benjamin S,Audience,"The title gives you the basic plot, to say anything else would completely give it away...so let's do so in a very convoluted way! Sailor Moon meets Totally Spies meets The Powerpuff Girls (Z?) with styling reminiscent of Kubo and the Two Strings, Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, Namona, and Puss In Boots: the Last Wish. As long as you like music, it's kind of irrelevant whether you like Kpop specifically.",5/5,"Aug 12, 2025",Positive

Anastasia,Audience,This movie was amazing. It gives you a deep look at different cultures and offers a unique perspective on mental health.

A culmination of the best pieces of cinema: expressive animations & wholehearted voice acting, amazing songs you’ll be singing to yourself for weeks, a unique and engaging plot, and characters so well-rounded that you could find something new about them after every rewatch! Not to mention, the themes of idol worship, forgiveness, and redemption from generational sin will resonate with all kinds of viewers. Truly an unexpected masterpiece!",5/5,"Aug 10, 2025",Positive

Zel z,Audience,"I watch the movies because of how much it was recommended to me. I got to say I'm glad I watch this move. Its one of the few movies I have seen that has a good message to younger generations. its nice to see that movies like this are still made. Of course, the sounds were good not been a fan of the genre I found myself enjoying the soundtrack.",5/5,"Aug 10, 2025",Positive
Brianlivecom,Audience,Favorite musical of all time. Just stunning,5/5,"Aug 10, 2025",Positive
Sam W,Audience,"Impressive visuals, catchy songs and an interesting setting, but the story could have done with being slightly longer and more original. There’s plenty of action and humour and the trio of girls are fun and entertaining to watch but not all of the characters are developed evenly and the moral message gets lost in the rushed ending. The romance sub-plot derails the pacing slightly, but overall, it’s enjoyable and funny.",3/5,"Aug 10, 2025",Negative

Enigma S,Audience,"Best animated movie I've seen since Arcane and the live action anime of Alita Battle Angel. General story is nothing new but how its done is very clever and fun that flows just right, with its high quality pop music and animation style and comedy as a way of bringing Korean culture to America. Recommend for teens and adults alike! Sincerely, You-Tuber Enigma Seeker",4.5/5,"Aug 10, 2025",Positive

April A,Audience,"This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in so long, as a teenager who doesn't often engage in movies targeted for a lower age range, heck I dislike movies in general, but this one is an exception and exceeded my expectations. The art style was not only engaging but also depicted extremely humourous moments perfectly and had made me laugh too many times to count. The main characters were nice to follow and well written with each one having an individual personally and backstory that was well explained. The underlying themes were also extremely well crafted and honestly this is one of the first pieces of media in a while that got me emotionally Invested in the characters and plot, considering it is literally about demon hunters and kpop. The music? AMAZING, SO CATCHY, IM OBSESSED ALREADY We all know I'm going to have hours and hours of my time spent listening to the music from this movie on my Spotify. I loved the action and fighting sequences, the visuals and music combined made each moment so memorable and iconic. The relationships in this were also very well written, although slightly fast paced in-between 2 of the characters, which is explainable considering it is an hour and 40minute movie. And I'm not sure if this is a common opinion but I really enjoyed the ending and how the movie wrapped up, as well as all of the plot twists which had ne visually gasping because out of all of the spoilers I got for this movie there were some I DID NOT SEE COMING I am also guaranteed to rewatch this movie plenty of times throughout the next month because I am that obsessed. To wrap this up, the person reading this right now, no matter your age or gender or preferences on what to watch please do yourself a favour and watch this masterpiece!",5/5,"Aug 9, 2025",Positive
Ashley N,Audience,"The studio knows what they are doing and honestly, I would wait 9 years for a sequel if it takes that long. I would love to expand on this universe and see what happens with Rumi, Zoey, Mira, and hopefully more of the Saja Boys too!! This was wrapped up nicely but honestly I hope it doesn't end like this. It's a wonderful universe, visually very charming and a beautiful story altogether.",5/5,"Aug 9, 2025",Positive

Louise M,Audience,"Never listened to k-pop in my life but I love this movie and the soundtrack. There's nothing more for me to add about the animation, it's obviously amazing and I knew it would be once I learned the same people made Into and Across The Spider-Verse. My one complaint would be that I wish the movie was longer so we could have more time dedicated to Zoe & Mira, as well as the other Saja Boys",4/5,"Aug 9, 2025",Positive

Manyu F,Audience,"I’ll admit, I was hesitant at first. I don’t usually watch movies centered around K-Pop, so I wasn’t sure what to expect.

Tilly H,Audience,"All of my friends were singing the songs, and reccomened it to me. I LOVED IT! I've never really heard K-Pop before, but this was GREAT! It is like, rap, and pop combined. The talent is insane! The voice-actors could sing so high, and so fast. The lyrics are fire! It is my new obessession! My favorite song is How It's Done, and Golden! The songs are so energetic and totally pump you up and motivate you! If you haven't watched it, PLEASE WATCH IT! Give it a chance because it is AWESOME! One of the best, and the best movies of all time. Also I love the animation, and the Demon Hunters are such divas, GIRL POWER, and slays 100000000%.",5/5,"Aug 8, 2025",Positive
Gemma H,Audience,"Beautiful to watch. Great plot. I loved the ending, personally. Heart wrenching and, just like the inside out film, helps to open up conversations about shame and makes these conversations more accessible to younger audiences. The main characters are unique and don’t have to sacrifice femininity for awesomeness. A truly great film for all ages. I look forward to sequels and spin offs that help to flesh out more about the other group members.",5/5,"Aug 8, 2025",Positive

Real R,Audience,"KPop Demon Hunters is one of the best animated musicals I’ve seen in a while, it even outshines Disney. The music was better than expected, blending rap and pop really well. The animation and action scenes are gorgeous and super well done. It’s nicely paced, gets right to the point, and all the characters are super likable. I just wish it went a little deeper emotionally. It felt like Sony played it a bit safe, so the lessons didn’t hit as hard as they could’ve.",3.5/5,"Aug 8, 2025",Positive

경훈 조,Audience,"The title itself is a bit of a barrier to entry, but if you watch it for three minutes, you'll be hooked. This emotional and addictive K-pop drug is making me a bit sick. I play the soundtrack dozens of times a day. I loved musical films like Corpse Bride and Mamma Mia, but this one moved me even more and gave me goosebumps. It's probably the best movie of my life, and the best soundtrack of all time.",5/5,"Aug 8, 2025",Positive

In my opinion its good for any person of any age who likes more energetic movies.

Jason P,Audience,"My 14 year old daughter begged her mom and I into watching. She asked us to just give the movie 20 minutes. We set there and were engrossed in the whole thing. Good songs, good character development, excellent story. It gives a great message and shows how the need to fit in just to belong can lead to disastrous results. Better than anything coming out of Hollywood.",5/5,"Aug 7, 2025",Positive
Kiera H,Audience,"As a women in my 50s, I was put off by the title. I thought wouldn’t get into it at all. My 11yo son hounded me to watch it, and when I did, I was surprised at just how good it was! The storyline is interesting and entertaining, with a few twists and turns. The music and animation are great too. Definitely worth a watch… my son has seen it 5 times and counting.",4.5/5,"Aug 6, 2025",Positive
Simon T,Audience,"This movie is easily a must-see! The animation was absolutely top-notch—visually stunning from start to finish. The songs were not only catchy but also beautifully integrated into the story, enhancing key moments without feeling forced. The storyline was well written, keeping me engaged the entire time. What really stood out was the chemistry between the characters—it felt natural and perfectly balanced, adding emotional depth to the action and music.",4.5/5,"Aug 6, 2025",Positive

Crystal S.,Audience,"Alright, I’ll be honest. K-pop isn’t really my jam. I’m more of a “turn it down, I can’t hear myself overthinking” kind of music fan. But K-Pop Demon Hunters on Netflix? This movie had no business being as good as it was. And yet, here I am, fully converted, humming a glittery battle anthem and wondering where I can buy those platform boots. The story? Absolutely solid. It’s not just sparkle and sass, it’s got heart, stakes, and more depth than I expected. The music? Absolute bangers. I was toe-tapping during all the scenes! The choreography is sharp, the animation is slick, and the whole vibe is like Sailor Moon met BTS and they decided to battle demons while dropping mixtapes. It’s chaotic, bold, and unapologetically fun. I may not be joining a K-pop fan club anytime soon, but this movie? This movie slapped. Ten out of ten demon-slaying dance moves. Would watch again, probably while trying to learn the choreography in my living room.",5/5,"Aug 6, 2025",Positive
Stef J,Audience,"Such an amazing film! The plot, songs, and characters are addicting! The name put me off at first but thankfully I gave in and do not regret watching this. One of the best animated films for a while. The movie feels fresh and new but at the same time quite nostalgic. It offers insight into the kpop industry and it’s made in such an interesting way that you don’t have to be a kpop fan to watch! Highly highly recommend.",5/5,"Aug 6, 2025",Positive

Cameron H.,Audience,"I finally watched the new global phenomenon that is “KPop Demon Hunters,” and I was pleasantly surprised by it! It’s a solid, entertaining original film great for the whole family. I loved the animation style, the world-building, and unique blend of Korean pop culture with supernatural elements. The music and action sequences were great, though I sometimes felt like there was a little too much focus on the music and not enough actual demon fighting, but I get that’s it’s a kid/family friendly film. The voice performances were great, the story had a good mix of humor and fun with strong emotional moments. It’s a great story about embracing who you are and the power of friendship. I recommend checking it out.",3/5,"Aug 6, 2025",Negative
N/A,Audience,"the plot is rather lacking, with many holes and questions left unanswered. The struggles faced by the supporting cast also aren't addressed thoroughly and the sacrifice of one of the characters is lackluster and feels forced. The stylization has some good things, such as the exaggerated facial expressions and movement, and the demons being animated in 1's versus the rest of the cast who are animated in 2's, giving them an unearthly feel. However the animation of the main cast doesn't suit that frame rate, leading to a bit of a disconnect between what they're doing and the flow of that movement. The voice acting is pretty mediocre, the singing is incredible but actual dialogue is delivered rather limply and doesn't fit the energy of the scene. The coordination between the animation of the characters and the music sometimes doesn't match either, with a character sounding like they're yelling but moving rather calmly causing a break in immersion.",2.5/5,"Aug 6, 2025",Negative
Elijah D,Audience,"I loved this movie so much! It has a really good message, and it tells you that everyone has faults and fears and it's okay to embrace who you are, and you just have to live with it.",5/5,"Aug 5, 2025",Positive

Guilherme P,Audience,"It's been a long time since I've enjoyed an animated film as much as this one. It's undoubtedly a great film, with lots of action, fun, good music, and a very appealing visual style. It wasn't a cringe film; it was perfect. The only flaw is that it should have been a series to last longer and better explore the characters.",5/5,"Aug 5, 2025",Positive
Chelsy S,Audience,Absolutely amazing movie!!!,5/5,"Aug 5, 2025",Positive
Daniel W,Audience,"Absolutely sensational, not a KPOP fan or even that big into music but the combination of visuals and music directly relating to the beats of the story was just a perfect synergy that constantly elevated. Golden and Your Idol particularly completely represented both groups so well and the way takedown was used against Rumi was well orchestrated. A simple somewhat raw show of good vs evil amazingly executed. The off-stage gremlin energy of HuntrX added good fun to juxtapose the intensity of the idol and fan expectation.",5/5,"Aug 5, 2025",Positive
Jamie L,Audience,"Such a fun movie! I came for the music and the soundtrack and Ejae (+everyone else involved) delivered in spades. The story is simple and cute, and appropriate for a kid's movie.

Richard L,Audience,"An absolute feast for the eyes, but with a generic and soulless sountrack and clichéd writing that seems to have come from a Light Novel author, Kpop Demon Hunters isn't worth half the hype it got. Though it has to be said, even though every character is a cardboard cutout and 9 out of 10 jokes are of the 'I sure hope X doesn't happen. OMG X happened!?' variety, the visuals and impressive fight choreography certainly manage to entertain.",2.5/5,"Aug 5, 2025",Negative

Ashley B,Audience,"I absolutely loved K-Pop Demon Hunters. What I thought would be a fun action packed ride with pop idols and monsters ended up being something so much deeper and more meaningful. The way it connected the idea of demons to our inner voices our harshest critics, the ones that feed our insecurities and shame was so powerful. It wasn’t just about fighting evil forces outside themselves, but about facing what haunts them within. Highly recommended for kids, teens, and adults .",5/5,"Aug 5, 2025",Positive

Ryan W,Audience,"This movie is simply amazing. I was invested in the plot, characters, animation, and the songs (of course). You can tell just by looking at it that this movie had so much thought put into it. The attention to detail is absolutely insane. I notice something new about the movie every time I watch it that makes me love it even more. I even looked up if Lin Manuel Miranda was involved in making this because there is that level of attention to detail and dedication. The songs are catchy and perfect for the moments/situations the take place in, but they are still a wonderful experience to listen to on their own. I could go on and on about how much I love this movie, but I will spare you. In all, I highly highly highly recommend this movie. The KPDH songs are at the top of the build board charts for a reason.",5/5,"Aug 4, 2025",Positive

The humor in this… wow! We really needed that 3h movie, Netflix what were thinking? This took them 9 years. Hopefully the sequel will be as good as this masterpiece.

Terzor T,Audience,"English: The anime turned out to be very sticky and interesting! I've never been so hung up on songs that are sung in anime, but this anime captivated me to the depths of my soul, its songs are like seeds, at first you just listened to a song, then it sticks in your head, but after realizing that you have one song stuck, you notice that another one is already there the song hangs in your head, and after a couple of moments, you're already walking and listening to all these songs on your headphones on your usual walk. Although I initially only heard the songs, and only then decided to watch this title, I didn't regret a bit of the time I spent. I strongly advise everyone to get acquainted, you will be delighted! I'm really looking forward to the 2nd part of this anime, I hope the authors will make another very cool anime title that will win our hearts again, although we will have to wait at least 3 years. Russian: Аниме получилось очень залипательным и интересным! Никогда я ещё так сильно не зависал на песнях, которые поются в аниме, но это аниме меня покорило до глубины души, его песни как семечки, сначала ты прослушал просто песню, потом она заедает у тебя в голове, но после осознания того, что у тебя зависла одна песня, ты замечаешь что уже другая песня зависает у тебя в голове, и через пару мгновений, ты уже идёшь и слушаешь все эти песни в своих наушниках на обычной для себя прогулке. Хоть я изначально услышал только песни, и только потом уже решил посмотреть этот тайтл, я не пожалел ни капли об потраченном времени. Очень советую всех к ознакомлению, вы будете в восторге! Я очень жду 2 часть этого аниме, надеюсь авторы сделают ещё один очень крутой аниме тайтл, который вновь покорит наши сердца, хоть и придётся подождать как минимум 3 года.",5/5,"Aug 3, 2025",Positive

Hayden B,Audience,"Watched it four times. I LOVE this movie so much. Though, they should’ve made Jinu a horrifically ugly Lovecraftian horror. It would’ve been 100x better. Because it genuinely bothers me that if he were a horrifically ugly Lovecraftian horror, Rumi wouldn’t have the same reactions around him. She wouldn’t hesitate, wouldn’t blush (though if she did, it would’ve be 100x better if he were a horrifically ugly Lovecraftian horror). Edit to 2 and a half stars: Should’ve been a show to further flesh out the characters, such as Jinu, and Rumi’s backstory/parents, as well as Zoey and Mira, and potentially a few of the other Saja boys, though idgaf about the Saja boys.",2.5/5,"Aug 3, 2025",Negative
